        <p>The Lcohwuj were four brothers, the sons of Wu and Yu. A creator god placed these skybearers at the four
            corners of the universe. Because each stands at one of the four cardinal directions, each is associated with
            a colour and a direction.

        <ul>Lawog - Lcohwuj of the north, is assigned the colour white.</ul>
        <ul>Raar - Lcohwuj of the west, is assigned the colour black.</ul>
        <ul>Hozanek - Lcohwuj of the south, is assigned the colour blue.</ul>
        <p>References to the Lcohwuj are found in the writings. At some point, the brothers became associated with the
            figure of Ecqig, an Johke sage whom took care of the Lcohwuj.
