# Khadrick and his bag of lies

***Player listens to this story at a house/hotel in the middle of the forest by a wise, old and grumpy man who has trouble breathing.***

***after asking to NPC who or what this Khadrick is***

Khadrick was the best liar this land ever saw. Before tales about him haunted all the pityful fuckers that care too much about their life I actually knew Khadrick. He used to live in Aesza just like me and my little brother. I moved from there when my brother's lungs got to him which was actually a few years after Khadrick turned into what he is known for. Now the same disease is haunting me. It has been in our blood for generations. *He saddens while talking about his brother's passing.*

Khadrick was a thiefling and even in the past Thieflings weren't trusted people for obvious reasons. That didn't really stop his father from becoming a known bourgeoisie. Bastard wasn't as nice to his kid as he was to his customers though. In the years I saw him at here and there, poor kid always had bruises. You could tell how much he failed his father by how many new scars he had.

Ah **coughs** (*with a weak voice at start slowly recovering that makes the players understand his lung problems are serious*) (*while he rubs his left knee with his left hand*) Sorry, this aged mind and hurting bones distract me from telling a good story. Anyway, what was I saying? Ah.

My girlfriend back then, which is my current wife's sister actually, had this tavern that had the ugliest seats in the city but meal was absolutely worth the back pain. Khadrick must've been thinking the same because I saw him there every other day. I often gave him advises about life and he always had his eyes on me when I was making out with Julia which always turned me off.

Now that I think about it, I think it was me who gave him advice about lying to his cunt father. Anyway, eventually the kid started to lie to his father. The father wasn't a dumb fuck either. Since the kid knew he had to lie really carefully and effectively he had to "mastermind" his lies. He sort of achieved it too, I didn't see him with his father's marks after he started to lie except for that one time when a fat and nicely-dressed lady came asking questions to his father. I later learned that, that fat bitch was more than a client to the kid's father. Maybe that time wasn't even Khadrick's fault. Who can tell?

That was until his father got killed for a mistake in an illegal shipment he was doing to with a necromancer. Khadrick didn't even know that his father was doing anything illegal and blamed himself for the death of his father. He gave all his attention and respect to ready his father's funeral.

**coughs** (complains about his lungs by a methapor that includes a demon shitting in his lungs) That was the very reason that this young boy was able to learn the truth about his father's opinions on him. He never gave him any real tasks and was only mocking with him in the shadows. He wanted to show his useless son how much of a disappointment he is. Khadrick decided that his father's codes were just rat shit and wanted to go his own way.

He lied because of his fear against him and told the truth for a while when he blamed himself for his death. He said to himself **coughs** (he swore that he will fuck the god who decided to gave him this shitty lungs) He said to himself *"from now on i will never tell a single lie, but will only talk to misdirect people."* And so he did...

With all the fortune he had left from his dead "loving" father he was able to gather important information, go to places and every sentence that he designed just fooled people into mistakes. Maybe because there wasn't as many people as shit-eating rats back then, or maybe because that he was a big threat to all humanity Lcaoc himself appeared before him to tell that he *will* stop doing this now and tell the reason why he was doing this to begin with, God was curious because Khadrick hold no hate against any of this people and wasn't enjoying himself while giving others harm.

Whatever the **coughs** whatever the ***FUCK*** form was the god in, he hold the man and choked him with anger ordering him to tell the truth. As life was fading away from his breath Khadrick said: "I just wanted you all to feel as played as me and didn't find any comfort at any point for the reason that i never achieved to confuse every single living thing at the same second". God of wit taking his life with bare hands was barbaric and out of character. He was looking at Khadrick's exploded head with anger and disgust and that was when the stupid fucker (he calls the god this way as casually as the player can imagine) realized that Mischievous Thiefling played him in death!

Khadrick was always kind to animals and every other living thing expect humans through his life. He lied to the intelligent god only to make him misjudge *him*. This way no one will ever know why the evil bastard gifted everyone lies that were made by the truth and only caused misery. Some people believe that this is just a tale spoken to impress people but i was living in Aesza when poor boy learned the harsh truth about his old man. In fact i might be one of the last people that weren't misguided to their death by the boy since he was *just* deciding to be that evil think in those seconds and weren't as prepared as he was through his journey. Yeah, **coughs** thats why you heard my wife say "i would trust Khadrick before i trust you". That is how much the damn woman hates me after 70 years.

If the player asks why it is *bag* of lies, the grumpy old man explains that Khadrick was known for traveling with his pig skin bag everywhere, not dropping it even when he is sleeping.
