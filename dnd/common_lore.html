        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <hr>
            <p>Long before they fought, gods were not only gods but, "All". There was nothing but the energy, the magic in reality and gods were the ones who tamed it into purity at the dawn of every coming day. Centuries later, forging holy light to their will caused them, to have an ego. Which had only one solution: Deciding who was better.</p>
            <p>They then started to fight. Lesser creatures were only wishing for the fighting to be over but that wasn't as good as it sounded. Incomprehensible and Immortal, Gods were not capable of forgiving another "Perfect Being" for their actions. Only because of the fact that they can do no mistake, all they ever did was to make decisions. Since they are incapable of changing what they are, each and every one of them will be thinking they were the right one until the end of time. Even breaking their promise to Mceeju.</p>
            <p>Over time, prayers of those who cannot read the future well were answered and the Gods stopped fighting... Only to create an even worse event for the reality they were in. They stopped communicating and all of them started making simpletons by themselves. Humans that come from Mceeju were different from each other in many ways but, could still serve in the same cycle to a God's benefit. That was when they decided to make peace with their differences and mustered their realities. In the meantime, creating all sorts of races scattered around the Astral Sea, originating from their plane.</p>
            <p>That was the start of us. Men who were created by Mceeju were capable of magic but, was lacking the intelligence and wisdom to use it properly. With their imperfectness and, because they were lacking any guide by the Gods, most of them perished instantly, causing the magic inside them to mix with air and flow through the universe. That was maybe intended, ruling all Gods must come with it's own perspective. Although since all ended up perishing, all supreme beings accepted the punishment for their mistakes. Their craft, by its very nature, tried to have it all with magic, making all the perfect gods face with their weaknesses. So they all judged themselves by their perfect sides. Once again perfecting their "light", their "promise", and, they were identical no longer.</p>
            <p>They all started to create more and more of these predictable yet mysterious humans. This time giving it tought with others, grouping up. Not all of them were thankful to their creator, and almost none of them were worthy of magic, but they were there. Through time Gods showed mercy and guided them for magic, greatness, glory, happiness, a bitter taste of immortality and so many other things that humans were not capable of taking notes and studying. Some of these humans achieved great deeds. Because there were no such treasury in the manhood worthy of their deed, Gods let them to become demigods as a reward. In the first ages these events were happening considerably often, but as the time passed there were almost no deeds left worthy of becoming a demigod.</p>
            <p>Races discovering eachother, even though they were made with the same gods, ended up not befriending each other, or breeding out of control. Losing control of the Weave, they faced a greater force. A force that can't be stopped by their creator, even. Mceeju.</p>
            <p>Mceeju afterwards split the Astral Sea, pulling a piece from every domain, created the Material Planes, captivating them. Elemental Chaos surrounding it was cast aside with a dimensional barrier thus creating the Inner Worlds as we know it, and races were split. Reaction from other gods, overwhelmed by this power, caused Mceeju to split everything once again, even Gods' Domains. Inner Worlds themselves were seperated, Overworld and Underworld was created and boundaries were forced. Outside the barrier was Outer Worlds, unifiying Elemental Chaos.</p>
            <p>Now united, Gods were "free" once again, causing Mceeju to "retire", allowing his order to be ruled by his'. After then, some chose to stick together, some chose to go their own way, and some even chose to descend to the Material Planes.</p>
        
            <h1>The Creation Myth</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>In the ancient Mythology, Uke and Veri are referred to as the Creators, the Makers, and the Forefathers. They were two of the first beings to exist and were said to be as wise as Mceeju. Mceeju also existed and is given less personification. He acts more like a light.</p>
            <p>Mceeju decides that, in order to preserve his legacy, he must create a race of beings who can worship them. He created Uke, Veri and Lcaoc. He blessed Lcaoc with a small part of his smarts and gave Uke and Veri an eternal light of life. Uke and Veri did the actual creating while Lcaoc guided them. First came Cyaxo, creator of all land. Then came Ehx, creator of all sky. Gods started to form after one another and finally, after a big collaboration, the Astral Sea was formed.</p>
            <p>In a long lost plane, animals were created first; however, with all of their howling and squawking they did not worship their creators and were thus banished forever to the forest. Unable to decide their strengths, Gods then formed man. Man is created first of mud, but they just crumbled and dissolved away. Once again man is created of multiple elements like wood, fire, air and mud but had no soul, and they soon forgot their makers. After that, unable to decide and in a heated argument, gods were interrupted by Mceeju. Then, with all gods combined, a more complex man was formed, out of flesh and bone. That is why early beings believed that meat was not just the cornerstone of their diet but, they were also made of the same stuff.</p>

            <p>The Lcohwuj were four brothers, the sons of Wu and Yu. A creator god placed these skybearers at the four
                corners of the universe. Because each stands at one of the four cardinal directions, each is associated
                with
                a colour and a direction.
            </p>
            <ul>Uufh (later replaced by Msauh) - Lcohwuj of the east.</ul>
            <ul>Lawog - Lcohwuj of the north, is assigned the colour white.</ul>
            <ul>Raar - Lcohwuj of the west, is assigned the colour black.</ul>
            <ul>Hozanek - Lcohwuj of the south, is assigned the colour blue.</ul>
            <p>References to the Lcohwuj are found in the writings. At some point, the brothers became associated with
                the
                figure of Ecqig, an Johke sage whom took care of the Lcohwuj.

            <p>An old civilization that has evolved and found great meaning in both magic and immortality. They made immortality possible and destroyed every meaning they've found within it. With their last magic, they left a warning for future, unfortunately too difficult to grasp, lacking their understanding of magic, life and time. They managed to process light, and believed to achieve a hive-mind society. Nobody knows how they disappeared.</p>
            <p>Their offsprings from humans tend to get a disoriented body with partial ancient bodyparts. They live for about a millenia years without aging beyond their thirties, body-wise. They are sterile.</p>

        <hr>
        <!-- Johke Era -->
        <div>
            <h2 id="Johke">Johke Era</h2>
            <p>A small time that captures the struggles of all gods before Mceeju interrupted and casted the Black Rain. Johke people were all more like Genasi despite their common depiction as Humans. Since their world got divided and was formed into Inner Planes, their fragments of history can be seen anywhere, albeit weak and unintelligeble.</p>
            <p>One thing that is understandable is their "Rixm Liox", their holy book. It speaks about their focal points, life, mythology and other information that they depict, such as their looks and achievements.</p>
            <p>Since they were the first ones, they have noted the first Johken.</p>
            <h3>The First Generation</h3>
            <ul>Pedgj: Male, meaning first. He married Giyec.</ul>
            <ul>Cxiyo: Male, meaning smile. The gods created Czequvev specifically for him to marry.</ul>
            <ul>Nefhehsex: Male, meaning disturbed. He never had the chance to marry but actually raped Czequvev, out of jealousy.</ul>
            <ul>Wiob: Male, meaning moon. He died of old age and later became the moon lord, hero of the moon. The woman Gugig was created just for him.</ul>
            <ul>Giyec: Female, meaning woman. She was created specifically to be the wife of Pedgj.</ul>
            <ul>Czequvev: Female, meaning specific she was a woman created specifically to be the wife of Cxiyo. Happily taking care of her first child Qceey (Son of Cxiyo) but committed suicide after her second child Ugiy (Daughter of Nefhehsex) was born.</ul>
            <ul>Gugig: Female, meaning water, she was a woman created by the gods specifically to marry Wiob.</ul>
            <h3>Susaih and Wiob</h3>
            <p>After the creation, Msauh's notes tells of the struggles of the legendary hero twins, Susaih and Wiob, in defeating the Pedi Lords, the underworld lords. The twins descend into the underworld, perish, and are eventually miraculously reborn. This myth provides a metaphor for the agricultural cycle and the annual rebirth of the crops. These two stories are focal points of early Johke Mythology and often found depicted in art, such as "Rixm Liox", the holy book of the Johke. "Rixm Liox" can be found in any part of the Inner Worlds.</p>
            <p>Susaih or Su was originally a son of one of Lcohwuj. His twin was Wiob. The two were the Johke Hero Twins.</p>
            <p>Susaih and his brother Wiob were quite inseperable in their lives, together outwitting arrogant gods and the lords of the underworld, Nee. Although it is not explicitly stated in the history, Wiob seems to have been the dominant one among the brothers, often the one to do the talking and the planning, although Susaih was not merely a hapless sidekick. In fact Susaih is credited with saving his older brother's life at least once.</p>
            <p>Susaih ascended to the Iz after his death and became associated with the sun. Susaih was sometimes referred to as the Lord of The Sun.</p>
