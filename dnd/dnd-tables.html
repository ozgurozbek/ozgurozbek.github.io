                in a month named after a bad aligned deity. This alignment also differs for the Runemaster's own
                religion. Evil aligned deities to themselves are good.

                A path for a chef. You select what effect you want your food to have, consult it with your DM, then a
                percentile will be rolled. You spend the amount of gold stated beforehand, so it can be lost. If
                proficient with chef's utensils or any other cooking equipment, percentage has a plus 25%. The chef can
                choose to add their wisdom modifier to the percentage. Snacks can be made in an instant, Everyday food
                requires a small rest, Gourmet food takes a long rest and can take multiple days. Select materials cost
                little. Choice materials cost more. Prime materials cost significantly higher. All materials can be
                scavenged. Materials also signify the duration that the food will keep its effects. Food goes to spoil
                after 24 hours. Starting from the worst, effect avaibilities are 1-3 hour, 3-7 hours and 5-11 hours.
