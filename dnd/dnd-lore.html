            <hr>
            <p>Long before their battles, gods were once "All," harnessing the energy and magic of reality. However, their egos led to conflicts and the need to determine superiority. Lesser creatures desired an end to the fighting, but gods, being immortal and unforgiving, couldn't accept another "Perfect Being's" actions.</p>
            <p>Eventually, prayers were answered, and the gods ceased fighting, but this created a worse situation. They stopped communicating and individually created humans from Mceeju, who, despite their differences, served the gods. The gods made peace with their divergences and established various races within the Astral Sea.</p>
            <p>Humans, lacking intelligence and divine guidance, possessed magic but often perished due to imperfections. Their deaths released magic into the universe. The gods accepted their punishment and judged themselves, losing their perfect nature and becoming distinct from one another.</p>
            <p>The gods continued to create humans, who exhibited predictable yet mysterious traits. They showed mercy and guided some humans towards greatness, rewarding them with demigod status. However, such accomplishments became scarce over time.</p>
            <p>Despite sharing the same creators, races clashed or multiplied uncontrollably, losing control of the Weave and facing an unstoppable force: Mceeju.</p>
            <p>Mceeju divided the Astral Sea, creating the Material Planes and the Inner Worlds while isolating the Elemental Chaos with a dimensional barrier. Races were divided, and even the gods' domains were split. The Overworld, Underworld, and Outer Worlds emerged.</p>
            <p>With newfound freedom, the gods led by Mceeju's order. Some stayed united, some pursued separate paths, and others descended to the Material Planes.</p>

            <p>An old civilization that has evolved and found great meaning in both magic and immortality. They made immortality possible and destroyed every meaning they've found within it. With their last magic, they left a warning for future, unfortunately too difficult to grasp, lacking their understanding of magic, life and time. They managed to process light, and believed to achieve a hive-mind society. Nobody knows how they disappeared.</p>
            <p>Their offsprings from humans tend to get a disoriented body with partial ancient bodyparts. They live for about a millenia years without aging beyond their thirties, body-wise. They are sterile.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Overseer Planes</h3>
            These are located in the Astral Sea.
            <ul>Beastlands: Rangers dream of it on a good night. This is pure wilderness of any environment with no rules past nature.</ul>
            <ul>Arboria: Governed by pure emotion, rage and joy are everpresent.</ul>
            <ul>Limbo: Most dangerous plane birthing the essence of chaos. Only strong minds can last more than a minute, and elements are randomly shuffled.</ul>
            <ul>Pandemonium: Plane of madness, screaming winds tearing through tunnels exist to torment poor souls.</ul>
            <ul>Abyss: Houses every nightmare imaginable and consists of endless layers with unique horrors. Some say the demon kings of the abyss occasionally venture to underdark to rampage.</ul>
            <ul>Carseri: Perfect prison. Six layers and uniquely cruel to its inhabitants.</ul>
            <ul>Gehenna: Plane of avarice, housing merciless and selfish.</ul>
            <ul>Acheron: Very difficult to picture. Iron cubes slamming into eachother at random, representing pain and war.</ul>
            <ul>Mechanus: Perfected clockwork plane. Housing a creature called Primus and his mechanical children.</ul>
            <ul>Arcadia is a realm of purity housing celestial bodies who live in harmony.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Elemental Planes</h3>
            <ul>Fire Plane: A place continuosly ablaze. Ground is nothing more than compressed flame and the most common fluid is magma. Fire burns here without fuel. Usually creatures that are somewhat comfortable in flames live here. Best known for its city, City of Brass. Certain devils also visit here and cause traffic of information, goods and prisoners between Nee. The City also blocks many of the destruction of flames, rendering it safe for travel from the material planes.</ul>
            <ul>Water Plane: Is an ocean without a surface. It is a domain of current and wave. An entirely fluid environment and is lit by a diffused glow. Any waterbreathing outsider can make this plane their home. There are large strongholds that are usually tied to some huge solid object, like a ball of seaweed. There is also the City of Glass, half filled with water and air.</ul>
            <ul>Earth Plane: It is a place of hidden riches and a wall for all. Various gems could be found here, although wise avoid it because of the constant earthquakes and heavy gravity. It is constantly in motion.</ul>
            <ul>Air Plane: As open as eternal sky and as solid as a child's breath and is falling forever. Weather is the main danger here. Is the most comfortable and survivable of the elemental planes. There is no ground but there are rocks or dirt floating around. There is no gravity, wherever you deem down becomes down but creatures unknowing about this have fallen to their deaths. Clouds appear plentiful.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Overworld</h3>
            <br>Guarded by Raajod. Ruled by Radu.
            <ul>Iz: Life and flowers represent this plane. Is divided into two paradises, tamed fields of crops and unkept wilderness representing understanding of freedom and law. Ruled by Vihi and Veri.</ul>
            <ul>Rubcudalm: The perfect place, realm of pure good and happiness. People don't just pass through here, it's nice.</ul>
            <ul>Rizug: Honor and might represents this plane. Heroes of war rise and fall in the eternal battlefields of Rizug. Rizug is never calm.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Inner Planes, Worlds</h3>
            <ul>Iyiyoke: Crushed planets of shortfolk and tallfolk.</ul>
            <ul>Nhaft: The world of Dwarves, one big continent, Pjegv in their tongue.</ul>
            <ul>Ecp: The world of Orcs, one big continent, Ikv in their tongue.</ul>
            <ul>Pceey: The world of Creatures, one big continent, Gtaaq in their tongue.</ul>
            <ul>Some from infinite options; Thaum, Teothe, Soulon or Pravukadz. These are generally mentioned as the material planes.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Underworld</h3>
            <br>Guarded by Raxy. Ruled by Pwazo.
            <ul>Nee: Death represents this plane. Hells of many numbers, each housed by horrible demons, fiends and with creatures of unimaginable power and cruelty.</ul>
            <ul>Cepx: Sickness and Diseases represent this plane. Layers of joylessness, hopelessness and apathy. People become sorrowful faced larvae slugging around in the mud.</ul>
            <ul>Diyp: Where dead gods are buried. Very difficult to picture, deities suffering from celestial starvation disappear here.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Others</h3>
            <ul>Negative Energy Plane: Seemingly empty vacuums with little to no life or matter. Seems to pull life and energy out of everything exposed to it. Is inky black and eats light.</ul>
            <ul>Positive Energy Plane: Seemingly empty vacuums with little to no life or matter. Seems to give life and energy to everything exposed to it. Is bright white and shines.</ul>
            <ul>Ethereal Plane: Mostly featureless, misty fog. Visibility is limited and many things are invisible. There is no gravity but a sense of up exists. You can pass through not living things. It is a means of travel between inner planes to outer planes. Ghosts can exist here. There is no food or water here.</ul>
            <ul>Astral Sea: The space between everything, road that goes everywhere. Place of thought and dream where visitors travel as disembodied souls. It is a great silvery sea. Mostly empty space but some parts from other planes find their way here. Certain spells touch the astral sea briefly. If your astral self is killed, you return to your body via the silver chord. It is a means of travel between inner planes to overseer planes. If the chord is severed, you and your body will die. It is possible to travel there with a physical body. Gateways appear here with a color, and appear randomly. Astral sea has many dangers and pirates with chord severing swords. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</ul>
            <ul>Far Realm: Exists outside everything, horrific aberration like mind flayers and observers originate from here.</ul>
            <ul>Outlands: A vast field that has towns based at its edges each is a settlement representing outer plane and is a gateway to that plane.</ul>
            <ul>Demi planes: Worlds created at random and are freely shaped by a person or a force that comes in contact with them. Powerful wizards can create their own worlds and isolate themselves inside or sometimes trap other creatures.</ul>
