            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Long before they fought, gods were not only gods but, "All". There was nothing but the energy, the magic in reality and gods were the ones who tamed it into purity at the dawn of every coming day. Centuries later, forging holy light to their will caused them, to have an ego. Which had only one solution: Deciding who was better.</p>
            <p>They then started to fight. Lesser creatures were only wishing for the fighting to be over but that wasn't as good as it sounded. Incomprehensible and Immortal, Gods were not capable of forgiving another "Perfect Being" for their actions. Only because of the fact that they can do no mistake, all they ever did was to make decisions. Since they are incapable of changing what they are, each and every one of them will be thinking they were the right one until the end of time. Even breaking their promise to Mceeju.</p>
            <p>Over time, prayers of those who cannot read the future well were answered and the Gods stopped fighting... Only to create an even worse event for the reality they were in. They stopped communicating and all of them started making simpletons by themselves. Humans that come from Mceeju were different from each other in many ways but, could still serve in the same cycle to a God's benefit. That was when they decided to make peace with their differences and mustered their realities. In the meantime, creating all sorts of races scattered around the Astral Sea, originating from their plane.</p>
            <p>That was the start of us. Men who were created by Mceeju were capable of magic but, was lacking the intelligence and wisdom to use it properly. With their imperfectness and, because they were lacking any guide by the Gods, most of them perished instantly, causing the magic inside them to mix with air and flow through the universe. That was maybe intended, ruling all Gods must come with it's own perspective. Although since all ended up perishing, all supreme beings accepted the punishment for their mistakes. Their craft, by its very nature, tried to have it all with magic, making all the perfect gods face with their weaknesses. So they all judged themselves by their perfect sides. Once again perfecting their "light", their "promise", and, they were identical no longer.</p>
            <p>They all started to create more and more of these predictable yet mysterious humans. This time giving it tought with others, grouping up. Not all of them were thankful to their creator, and almost none of them were worthy of magic, but they were there. Through time Gods showed mercy and guided them for magic, greatness, glory, happiness, a bitter taste of immortality and so many other things that humans were not capable of taking notes and studying. Some of these humans achieved great deeds. Because there were no such treasury in the manhood worthy of their deed, Gods let them to become demigods as a reward. In the first ages these events were happening considerably often, but as the time passed there were almost no deeds left worthy of becoming a demigod.</p>
            <p>Races discovering eachother, even though they were made with the same gods, ended up not befriending each other, or breeding out of control. Losing control of the Weave, they faced a greater force. A force that can't be stopped by their creator, even. Mceeju.</p>
            <p>Mceeju afterwards split the Astral Sea, pulling a piece from every domain, created the Material Planes, captivating them. Elemental Chaos surrounding it was cast aside with a dimensional barrier thus creating the Inner Worlds as we know it, and races were split. Reaction from other gods, overwhelmed by this power, caused Mceeju to split everything once again, even Gods' Domains. Inner Worlds themselves were seperated, Overworld and Underworld was created and boundaries were forced. Outside the barrier was Outer Worlds, unifiying Elemental Chaos.</p>
            <p>Now united, Gods were "free" once again, causing Mceeju to "retire", allowing his order to be ruled by his'. After then, some chose to stick together, some chose to go their own way, and some even chose to descend to the Material Planes.</p>
        
            <h2>The Creation Myth</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In the ancient Mythology, Uke and Veri are referred to as the Creators, the Makers, and the Forefathers. They were two of the first beings to exist and were said to be as wise as Mceeju. Mceeju also existed and is given less personification. He acts more like a light.</p>
            <p>Mceeju decides that, in order to preserve his legacy, he must create a race of beings who can worship them. He created Uke, Veri and Lcaoc. He blessed Lcaoc with a small part of his smarts and gave Uke and Veri an eternal light of life. Uke and Veri did the actual creating while Lcaoc guided them. First came Cyaxo, creator of all land. Then came Ehx, creator of all sky. Gods started to form after one another and finally, after a big collaboration, the Astral Sea was formed.</p>
            <p>In a long lost plane, animals were created first; however, with all of their howling and squawking they did not worship their creators and were thus banished forever to the forest. Unable to decide their strengths, Gods then formed man. Man is created first of mud, but they just crumbled and dissolved away. Once again man is created of multiple elements like wood, fire, air and mud but had no soul, and they soon forgot their makers. After that, unable to decide and in a heated argument, gods were interrupted by Mceeju. Then, with all gods combined, a more complex man was formed, out of flesh and bone. That is why early beings believed that meat was not just the cornerstone of their diet but, they were also made of the same stuff.</p>

            <p>The Lcohwuj were four brothers, the sons of Wu and Yu. A creator god placed these skybearers at the four corners of the universe. Because each stands at one of the four cardinal directions, each is associated with a colour and a direction.</p>
            <ul>Uufh (later replaced by Msauh) - Lcohwuj of the east.</ul>
            <ul>Lawog - Lcohwuj of the north, is assigned the colour white.</ul>
            <ul>Raar - Lcohwuj of the west, is assigned the colour black.</ul>
            <ul>Hozanek - Lcohwuj of the south, is assigned the colour blue.</ul>
            <p>References to the Lcohwuj are found in the writings. At some point, the brothers became associated with the figure of Ecqig, an Johke sage whom took care of the Lcohwuj.</p>

            <p>An old civilization that has evolved and found great meaning in both magic and immortality. They made immortality possible and destroyed every meaning they've found within it. With their last magic, they left a warning for future, unfortunately too difficult to grasp, lacking their understanding of magic, life and time. They managed to process light, and believed to achieve a hive-mind society. Nobody knows how they disappeared.</p>
            <p>Their offsprings from humans tend to get a disoriented body with partial ancient bodyparts. They live for about a millenia years without aging beyond their thirties, body-wise. They are sterile.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 id="Johke">Johke Era</h2>
            <p>A small time that captures the struggles of all gods before Mceeju interrupted and casted the Black Rain. Johke people were all more like Genasi despite their common depiction as Humans. Since their world got divided and was formed into Inner Planes, their fragments of history can be seen anywhere, albeit weak and unintelligeble.</p>
            <p>One thing that is understandable is their "Rixm Liox", their holy book. It speaks about their focal points, life, mythology and other information that they depict, such as their looks and achievements.</p>
            <p>Since they were the first ones, they have noted the first Johken.</p>
            <h3>The First Generation</h3>
            <ul>Pedgj: Male, meaning first. He married Giyec.</ul>
            <ul>Cxiyo: Male, meaning smile. The gods created Czequvev specifically for him to marry.</ul>
            <ul>Nefhehsex: Male, meaning disturbed. He never had the chance to marry but actually raped Czequvev, out of jealousy.</ul>
            <ul>Wiob: Male, meaning moon. He died of old age and later became the moon lord, hero of the moon. The woman Gugig was created just for him.</ul>
            <ul>Giyec: Female, meaning woman. She was created specifically to be the wife of Pedgj.</ul>
            <ul>Czequvev: Female, meaning specific she was a woman created specifically to be the wife of Cxiyo. Happily taking care of her first child Qceey (Son of Cxiyo) but committed suicide after her second child Ugiy (Daughter of Nefhehsex) was born.</ul>
            <ul>Gugig: Female, meaning water, she was a woman created by the gods specifically to marry Wiob.</ul>
            <h3>Susaih and Wiob</h3>
            <p>After the creation, Msauh's notes tells of the struggles of the legendary hero twins, Susaih and Wiob, in defeating the Pedi Lords, the underworld lords. The twins descend into the underworld, perish, and are eventually miraculously reborn. This myth provides a metaphor for the agricultural cycle and the annual rebirth of the crops. These two stories are focal points of early Johke Mythology and often found depicted in art, such as "Rixm Liox", the holy book of the Johke. "Rixm Liox" can be found in any part of the Inner Worlds.</p>
            <p>Susaih or Su was originally a son of one of Lcohwuj. His twin was Wiob. The two were the Johke Hero Twins.</p>
            <p>Susaih and his brother Wiob were quite inseperable in their lives, together outwitting arrogant gods and the lords of the underworld, Nee. Although it is not explicitly stated in the history, Wiob seems to have been the dominant one among the brothers, often the one to do the talking and the planning, although Susaih was not merely a hapless sidekick. In fact Susaih is credited with saving his older brother's life at least once.</p>
            <p>Susaih ascended to the Iz after his death and became associated with the sun. Susaih was sometimes referred to as the Lord of The Sun.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Overseer Planes</h3>
            These are located in the Astral Sea.
            <ul>Beastlands: Rangers dream of it on a good night. This is pure wilderness of any environment with no rules past nature.</ul>
            <ul>Arboria: Governed by pure emotion, rage and joy are everpresent.</ul>
            <ul>Limbo: Most dangerous plane birthing the essence of chaos. Only strong minds can last more than a minute, and elements are randomly shuffled.</ul>
            <ul>Pandemonium: Plane of madness, screaming winds tearing through tunnels exist to torment poor souls.</ul>
            <ul>Abyss: Houses every nightmare imaginable and consists of endless layers with unique horrors. Some say the demon kings of the abyss occasionally venture to underdark to rampage.</ul>
            <ul>Carseri: Perfect prison. Six layers and uniquely cruel to its inhabitants.</ul>
            <ul>Gehenna: Plane of avarice, housing merciless and selfish.</ul>
            <ul>Acheron: Very difficult to picture. Iron cubes slamming into eachother at random, representing pain and war.</ul>
            <ul>Mechanus: Perfected clockwork plane. Housing a creature called Primus and his mechanical children.</ul>
            <ul>Arcadia is a realm of purity housing celestial bodies who live in harmony.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Elemental Planes</h3>
            <ul>Fire Plane: A place continuosly ablaze. Ground is nothing more than compressed flame and the most common fluid is magma. Fire burns here without fuel. Usually creatures that are somewhat comfortable in flames live here. Best known for its city, City of Brass. Certain devils also visit here and cause traffic of information, goods and prisoners between Nee. The City also blocks many of the destruction of flames, rendering it safe for travel from the material planes.</ul>
            <ul>Water Plane: Is an ocean without a surface. It is a domain of current and wave. An entirely fluid environment and is lit by a diffused glow. Any waterbreathing outsider can make this plane their home. There are large strongholds that are usually tied to some huge solid object, like a ball of seaweed. There is also the City of Glass, half filled with water and air.</ul>
            <ul>Earth Plane: It is a place of hidden riches and a wall for all. Various gems could be found here, although wise avoid it because of the constant earthquakes and heavy gravity. It is constantly in motion.</ul>
            <ul>Air Plane: As open as eternal sky and as solid as a child's breath and is falling forever. Weather is the main danger here. Is the most comfortable and survivable of the elemental planes. There is no ground but there are rocks or dirt floating around. There is no gravity, wherever you deem down becomes down but creatures unknowing about this have fallen to their deaths. Clouds appear plentiful.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Overworld</h3>
            <br>Guarded by Raajod. Ruled by Radu.
            <ul>Iz: Life and flowers represent this plane. Is divided into two paradises, tamed fields of crops and unkept wilderness representing understanding of freedom and law. Ruled by Vihi and Veri.</ul>
            <ul>Rubcudalm: The perfect place, realm of pure good and happiness. People don't just pass through here, it's nice.</ul>
            <ul>Rizug: Honor and might represents this plane. Heroes of war rise and fall in the eternal battlefields of Rizug. Rizug is never calm.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Inner Planes, Worlds</h3>
            <ul>Iyiyoke: Crushed planets of shortfolk and tallfolk.</ul>
            <ul>Nhaft: The world of Dwarves, one big continent, Pjegv in their tongue.</ul>
            <ul>Ecp: The world of Orcs, one big continent, Ikv in their tongue.</ul>
            <ul>Pceey: The world of Creatures, one big continent, Gtaaq in their tongue.</ul>
            <ul>Some from infinite options; Thaum, Teothe, Soulon or Pravukadz. These are generally mentioned as the material planes.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Underworld</h3>
            <br>Guarded by Raxy. Ruled by Pwazo.
            <ul>Nee: Death represents this plane. Hells of many numbers, each housed by horrible demons, fiends and with creatures of unimaginable power and cruelty.</ul>
            <ul>Cepx: Sickness and Diseases represent this plane. Layers of joylessness, hopelessness and apathy. People become sorrowful faced larvae slugging around in the mud.</ul>
            <ul>Diyp: Where dead gods are buried. Very difficult to picture, deities suffering from celestial starvation disappear here.</ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Others</h3>
            <ul>Negative Energy Plane: Seemingly empty vacuums with little to no life or matter. Seems to pull life and energy out of everything exposed to it. Is inky black and eats light.</ul>
            <ul>Positive Energy Plane: Seemingly empty vacuums with little to no life or matter. Seems to give life and energy to everything exposed to it. Is bright white and shines.</ul>
            <ul>Ethereal Plane: Mostly featureless, misty fog. Visibility is limited and many things are invisible. There is no gravity but a sense of up exists. You can pass through not living things. It is a means of travel between inner planes to outer planes. Ghosts can exist here. There is no food or water here.</ul>
            <ul>Astral Sea: The space between everything, road that goes everywhere. Place of thought and dream where visitors travel as disembodied souls. It is a great silvery sea. Mostly empty space but some parts from other planes find their way here. Certain spells touch the astral sea briefly. If your astral self is killed, you return to your body via the silver chord. It is a means of travel between inner planes to overseer planes. If the chord is severed, you and your body will die. It is possible to travel there with a physical body. Gateways appear here with a color, and appear randomly. Astral sea has many dangers and pirates with chord severing swords. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</ul>
            <ul>Far Realm: Exists outside everything, horrific aberration like mind flayers and observers originate from here.</ul>
            <ul>Outlands: A vast field that has towns based at its edges each is a settlement representing outer plane and is a gateway to that plane.</ul>
            <ul>Demi planes: Worlds created at random and are freely shaped by a person or a force that comes in contact with them. Powerful wizards can create their own worlds and isolate themselves inside or sometimes trap other creatures.</ul>
