This was supposed to be impossible but with enough bargain from Warlock patrons and Divine sacrifices -such as souls- this feat was achieved. Then, in an instant, the ones involved were cursed and most banished. The artifact still stays, punished to walk the material planes for all the years remained in those harvested souls. It changes every midday and its memories vanish. Cleansing this item will grant the one cleric a throne in Life domain, and using it will help regain some amount of weave (spell-slots).</div>

Battling three ways, they killed over 3.5 million dwarves, many traders from the Dwarven Trade Route, important scholar Christopher A27, and Elanil Gredove. The multilayered city collapsed on its underground part called Below-Akash (or Gesag-Akash in Dwarvish) as the dragon emerged victorious. Unfortunately being grabbed by the iron golem guarding Athenaeum, the dragon hastily decided to get rid of the hostile environment and cost infinite amounts of gold in damage to the city. Tales tell that this event was triggered by a cowardly attack on the dragon, struck by William Lestrange.</div>
