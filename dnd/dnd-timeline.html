Ecqig: Great sage of Johke
Msauh: Sage of Johke
Lawog: Bigger brother of 4

The Lcohwuj were four brothers, the sons of Wu and Yu. A creator god placed these skybearers at the four corners of the
universe. Because each stands at one of the four cardinal directions, each is associated with a colour and a direction.
Uufh (later replaced by Msauh) - Lcohwuj of the east.
Lawog - Lcohwuj of the north, is assigned the colour white.
Raar - Lcohwuj of the west, is assigned the colour black.
Hozanek - Lcohwuj of the south, is assigned the colour blue.
References to the Lcohwuj are found in the writings. At some point, the brothers became associated with the figure of
Ecqig, an Johke sage whom took care of the Lcohwuj.

Ancients
An old civilization that has evolved and found great meaning in both magic and immortality. They made immortality
possible and destroyed every meaning they've found within it. With their last magic, they left a warning for future,
unfortunately too difficult to grasp, lacking their understanding of magic, life and time. They managed to process
light, and believed to achieve a hive-mind society. Nobody knows how they disappeared.
Their offsprings from humans tend to get a disoriented body with partial ancient bodyparts. They live for about a
millenia years without aging beyond their thirties, body-wise. They are sterile.

Johke Era
A small time that captures the struggles of all gods before Mceeju interrupted and casted the Black Rain. Johke people
were all more like Genasi despite their common depiction as Humans. Since their world got divided and was formed into
Inner Planes, their fragments of history can be seen anywhere, albeit weak and unintelligeble.
One thing that is understandable is their "Rixm Liox", their holy book. It speaks about their focal points, life,
mythology and other information that they depict, such as their looks and achievements.
Since they were the first ones, they have noted the first Johken.

The First Generation
Pedgj: Male, meaning first. He married Giyec.
Cxiyo: Male, meaning smile. The gods created Czequvev specifically for him to marry.
Nefhehsex: Male, meaning disturbed. He never had the chance to marry but actually raped Czequvev, out of jealousy.
Wiob: Male, meaning moon. He died of old age and later became the moon lord, hero of the moon. The woman Gugig was
created just for him.
Giyec: Female, meaning woman. She was created specifically to be the wife of Pedgj.
Czequvev: Female, meaning specific she was a woman created specifically to be the wife of Cxiyo. Happily taking care of
her first child Qceey (Son of Cxiyo) but committed suicide after her second child Ugiy (Daughter of Nefhehsex) was born.
Gugig: Female, meaning water, she was a woman created by the gods specifically to marry Wiob.
Susaih and Wiob
After the creation, Msauh's notes tells of the struggles of the legendary hero twins, Susaih and Wiob, in defeating the
Pedi Lords, the underworld lords. The twins descend into the underworld, perish, and are eventually miraculously reborn.
This myth provides a metaphor for the agricultural cycle and the annual rebirth of the crops. These two stories are
focal points of early Johke Mythology and often found depicted in art, such as "Rixm Liox", the holy book of the Johke.
"Rixm Liox" can be found in any part of the Inner Worlds.
Susaih or Su was originally a son of one of Lcohwuj. His twin was Wiob. The two were the Johke Hero Twins.
Susaih and his brother Wiob were quite inseperable in their lives, together outwitting arrogant gods and the lords of
the underworld, Nee. Although it is not explicitly stated in the history, Wiob seems to have been the dominant one among
the brothers, often the one to do the talking and the planning, although Susaih was not merely a hapless sidekick. In
fact Susaih is credited with saving his older brother's life at least once.
Susaih ascended to the Iz after his death and became associated with the sun. Susaih was sometimes referred to as the
Lord of The Sun.
