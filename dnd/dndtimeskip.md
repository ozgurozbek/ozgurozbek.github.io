### Divine curtain: Divinity no longer can descend due to underworld and overworld ties breaking

Underworld and Overworld have clashed in what is known to be the war between "Angels", "Demons" and "Aboleths". This event is referred to as "Corrosion of Rods" by the invested ones. This ended up breaking, and cutting the so called Highway of Divinity, or divine rods, to the Material Planes, which is referred to as "Divine Curtain". The Material planes were also tainted by the scattered pieces of this collision.

|       | Iz                                                    | Rubcudalm                                               | Rizug                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Nee   | Vibrant fields of life intertwined with death         | A realm of purity and happiness with a touch of mystery | Battle-scarred landscapes filled with honor and might |
| Cepx  | Sickness and disease entwined with despair            | Layers of sorrow and apathy amidst lingering sickness   | Mysterious realms of war and chaos                    |
| Diyp  | Resting place for fallen gods amidst celestial decay  | Tranquil realm where divine suffering finds solace      | Eternal burial ground for celestial beings            |

"Vocals" (as in vocal chords) of Underworld and Overworld generate spiralling portals around eachother, transporting creatures into different planes of existence and converting them into an amalgamation of both evil and good, they are creatures not to be feared as they are mindless and weak, but act on their own agenda. These chords can be found next to the above 9 pieces.

Going through this spiraling portal also introduces Smears, or Vocal Pests. Some take them as pets, most kill them, miniscule amount use them as labour or fighters. Eating Smears is a weird topic.

There is also the Shattering of Logic, Underworld and Overworld clash and crash into the material marbles, generating new material planes but no longer connecting them. This made many scholarly work obsolete, and the understanding of "The Marble" was simply fucked.

### The legend of Virimelle, a pure elf with hatred towards half elves. Killing

Virimelle, debated avatar of the Elven deity Corellon or a brain-washed avatar of Gruumsh on the quest to preserve and purify the elven blood. They kill half elves on sight, on a quest to purge and occasionally humans. They haven't been able to be stopped until an interference from the Divine. Some say they have ascended, some say they've been sent into Teothe's Alean's Grave, and some say they've won the conquest against the Divine and are coming for the other half-elves. The name of Virimelle is a topic to be avoided next to half-elves. There are some fanatic elves that support Virimelle's quest.

### Maggot Eater

The half-ancient Maggot Eater has amassed a massive army that is in the shape of a single maggot, traversing the passages in Underdark. Maggot Eater is there because it is aware that the threat in the Underdark is bigger, and he can further improve his strength. Maggot Eater is also re-opening and cleaning the half-ancient shrines. The Legend of Steram talks about this, written by a Tortle named Diwmit Troutsnout.

### Gaarnt zombie olayı ve nukelanması

Gaarnt of Teothe have conducted a fast-spreading flesh-eating disease that ended up attracting Mind Flayers and Myconids to the area. Realizing this, for the very first time in History of Teothe, All major races of Teothe signed a peace treaty and overwhelmed the area with high level spell barricade for days. This event is now referred to as The Gaarnt Incident. This also reminded the mages of General Jet, and how dated it ended up being. Right after, humans tried to settle in, but this proved to be a difficult task as Elves took up most the space, and the remaining area of Thireuk is filled with tainted magic.

### Volcano Eruption: Size is admirable as a volcano breathing fire still has a repulsive beauty

The Seimon Volcano erupted, and caused a climate change. It was so devastating that due to it breathing fire with a repulsive beauty, it provided new ground all over the globe, and with the change of flow and climate, it changed the sea level.

### Akash melt

Akash disappeared to history books. It was almost rebuilt but due to high standards of Dwarves, it never came to an end and as the volcano caused a shift in sea levels, Akash with its underground levels sank under the sea. Now, many "gold-diggers" go delving into the area in search for riches, but they were mostly extracted. It is now a tourist attraction for diving enthusiasts and a place to call home for sea-creatures.

### Auriel's area became independent: Tribes of Blight, Young ambitious state -Thaumans, Chultans, Mullans, Negbarians and Kleians

The continent of Ish declared independency from the Elkian Dominion. They were an unlawful area, then unionized under the Dwarven law, and settled with big influence of Goliath culture. This may seem odd, but since they were inhabitants from different planes, this tribal formation helped them settle in. Major cities were deformed. Inhabitants here use heavily electricized tools and armaments. One thing to note is almost all inhabitants here have blonde hair with bright white-smoke eyes. This is a continent that is closed to outsiders.

The inhabitants are mostly very capable humans from mostly 6 planes:
Teothe - Teothians
Thaum - Thaumans (A big solid continent with a promising Paladin's guild, and blue-folk.)
Chull - Chultans
Mulle - Mullans
Negbarin - Negbarians (A world of smaller islands composed with mistlands. They have amazing hunters.)
Klein - Kleians (A world that once existed before a comet hit. They had artificial gaps in their landmass and the apparent lack of magic made them all skilled workers. Klein was then rebuilt by the Demigoddess Ruby.)

### Black powder revolution

#### Technology and Weaponry

Black powder could be used to create firearms or explosive devices within the world. This introduces a new class of weapons, such as muskets, pistols, cannons, or even magical firearms powered by black powder. These weapons can have different properties and require specialized training to use effectively.

#### Political and Social Impact

Druidic factions or Elven nations have distaste towards Black powder and Dwarves don't consider the usage as it is not as worthy. Humans vie for control over the production and distribution of black powder, leading to power struggles, wars, or secret trade deals. This provides opportunities for political intrigue, espionage, or quests related to securing or sabotaging black powder supplies.

#### Magical Interactions

Black powder's explosive nature have interesting interactions with Evocation and Alteration magic. Combining certain spells with black powder explosions enhances their effects when crafted successfully as a magical-bomb, or create unique magical phenomena as it is a shadow-catalyst for Alteration, making the end result Shadow-weave-y.

#### Industrialization and Innovation

The introduction of black powder lead to technological advancements beyond weaponry. Development of new machinery (Train starters and stoppers, Underwater rockets), and mining techniques (TNT, Shockers (Which is a rock cracker using the shockwaves of gunpowder)). This opens up opportunities for interaction with inventors, engineers, or entrepreneurs.

### Two elven nations merge into one, but they elect a council of superiors to live in an island that holds the most prestigious higher education institute

Kheranthe was the superior one in military, and due to bureacracy moving Feianthe into Kheranthe was the better option as Dwarves pulled back from Akairo. Feianthe's royals still live in Fei, under the name of Feianthe -but it is Kheranthe-.

### Hanging Steamcart (Suspended Monorail) Technological Advancement

Thanks to Isaac's discoveries, books, and steam studies, Dwarves have built the longest monorail train track with the help of human labour. Underdark inhabitants dislike this because it fiddled with the land a lot. It is mostly straight with 16 stops. It cuts the travel time to mere hours per stop. From one end to the other, it only takes 8 days of travel. **THIS WILL EFFECT THE CITIES MASSIVELY!**

### Cultural Shifts

- Elves became more secluded and slow in their politics.

### Purple mosquitoes

They have emerged while filling caves and many passages in Elkia. This unfortunately blocked a lot of travellers or adventurers, and then acted as a barrier for the Drow. This caused many deaths, and there is still no cure besides chopping one's extremity off. Once stung, the mosquitoes will lay eggs in that wound, eggs acting as a parasite. Once they are grown, they will make their way to the closest cool, damp and dark area and set up nests. Mosquitoe nests look like big cocoons, if there are many side by side, they take on an hexagonal shape. They have corpses in their cocoons to feed off and lay more eggs if necessary. A lot of corpses make one a queen mosquito.

### A big earthquake caused by the Kuo-Toa have sunk the artificial pond in Elkia

### Understanding of magic have evolved

Many scholars have developed additional magic. One in particular "The Headmage of Konark" Sivirron Paracix, have developed a technique to create new flavors of magic, helping the understanding over different types of magic, such as ancient weave, faerzress to grow and to be studied.

### The relic of Thor Ealinar is now held by the Pearl Plunderers, and even though they couldn't use it, it has an inscription on it talking about time travel to future

Days are where I live.
Woken time and time over.
Bring the cleric and the medic:
Where can I live but days?

### The Elemental Monk

Coming from the Elemental planes, the Genasi monk *genasi name* revolutionised laborers, mostly miners, to use weave infused gauntlets instead of pickaxes and hoes to enrich the material

### Evolution of Magic Schools or Orders

These have changed, General Jet's Reform and books written by many adventurers having magic access as a necessity changed the attitude towards magic. Humans especially seem to not care or forget about the Mage's Crisis.

### Communication

Sending stones became more common amongst commoners, and postal service has changed. Now there are small, square Sending Books with 100 papers in them that you write your message in and fold it into a paper plane. The message can carry 20 words maximum. These paper planes when thrown must be done while thinking about the destination. If the destination is unknown roll *failure table*. If you want a more direct way, you can now hire Ethereal Messengers that will take the relevant information from you and travel in the ethereal plane to your target. During sleep, this is instant but the messenger has a 5% change of getting lost, and another 5% chance of not being able to return. The traditional way of Hiring bards to deliver messages by tracking and Druids to carve messages to spots also exist. Everyone now has mailboxes or cities have in-city postal services

A necromancer of immense power establishes an empire where undead serve as both labor force and military, challenging the living realms. This Herald inhabits the new Akairo, Kaio, and after wreaking havoc, was captured in a riddle-box that is now in *city*.

### The Fading of Magic

```txt
Rabbie, after patrolling and doing the deed with Sen Nar for a long time and sure as shit hunting down Felix
Rabbie is doing good in his mind, but being a vampire for such a long time and having seen such drastic changes in the world
also spending a lot of time with Sen Nar who has a fucked up moral compass herself
loses his direction
he still considers what he does to be good, but it actually isn't
he starts killing random people in random places occasionally, getting identified as a vampire every now and then in different places, burning down millers etc
he justifies it as "I'm keeping them in check and not letting them not be on guard"
what he does is without a question a very bad thing, and he eventually gets hunt down
but until that point somewhere in elkian dominion he causes a lot of trouble without causing enough trouble to turn their fate to despair
that area is now where elkian dominion trains a lot of soldiers and any peasant boy who wants to make a new life for himself considers traveling to that part of the kingdom
he also has been to a lot of dungeons and caves in his adventures
and whenever he finds a very dangerous place he does something for the "greater good" and sets up traps at their entrance
because if he makes them lose a limb or lose a person of the party at start, they will just go back and that means he "saved" the rest
he also hunted down various knights of Akairo (I believe there was 6 but they get replaced eventually so he could've killed multiple)
if the ruler's understanding of good contradicts rabbie, he kills them for "greater good" also
like I said his moral compass has been fucked all over but the inconvenience he causes at all these places have some sort of evolved the people around there
rabbie died when he attacked a monastery to keep the clerics in check
because radiant hurts

```txt
first of all
too many new kinds of spiders
that he created
just mixing shit up
glowing ones, poisonous ones, venomous ones, fast ones, little ones, big ones
a vast variety of spiders
but this is just a side effect of his adventures it wasn't really his aim
red holds a grudge to all this divine shit still, he doesn't like authority and he hates that he has to leave his family for multiple decades
he has a resentment
when they argue with kredi deep down he blames the divine because they made him kill auriel
it was something he wanted to do aswell but still
Aicho, agregcod ve etraftaki küçük settlementlar
geçtiğimiz bin yıllar içerisinde extremely inançsızlaştı
ki hatırlarsan aichoya bunu ben yapmayı çalışacağımı söylemiştim sana zaten daha campaign boka girmeden
very unusual hani shrine yok cleric yok
especially aicho çok fazla barda ve büyük bir casinoya sahip olduğu için turistik ve etik kuralların bendlendiği bir yer
bölgenin yönetimi ve insanları da artık buna göre şekillenmiş
bu net pozitif ya da net negatif bir durum değil sadece noticably farklı buraların kültürü preferanceları vs diğer yerlere göre
praying is sort of a taboo ve insanlar divine hakkında çok bilgisiz olduğu için hepsi greater godlara inanıyo sadece
etrafta sana durumu anlatıp propaganda yapabilecek preacherlar priestler de yok çünkü bards can resurrect so they sort of replaced clerics
```

### Drinks

If fermented Smears yield a bitter taste without being hoppy, there are a few ways you could incorporate them into a drink or alcohol:

- Smear Bitter: Similar to a traditional herbal bitter, you could create a Smear-infused bitter by macerating or steeping fermented Smears in a high-proof spirit, such as vodka or grain alcohol. This Smear bitter can be used as a component in cocktails to add depth and complexity to the flavor profile.
- Smear Amaro: Building on the bitter concept, you could create a Smear-based amaro. Amaro is an Italian liqueur known for its bitter-sweet flavor. By blending fermented Smears with a combination of herbs, spices, and other botanicals, you can produce a unique and slightly bitter liqueur that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a key ingredient in cocktails.
- Smear Tonic: Utilizing the bitter taste of fermented Smears, you could experiment with creating a Smear tonic. Tonic water typically contains quinine, which provides its characteristic bitterness. By incorporating fermented Smears and other botanicals, you can develop a homemade Smear tonic that adds a distinct bitter note to classic gin and tonic or other mixed drinks.
- Smear-infused Craft Beer: If the fermented Smears offer a bitter taste, but not specifically hoppy, you could consider incorporating them into craft beer recipes. Smear-infused beer could contribute a unique bitterness and potentially add depth to the overall flavor profile. Experimentation with different beer styles, such as stouts or Belgian ales, could be fruitful when incorporating fermented Smears.

### Comments of a Smear Chef

As a highly educated culinary chef, I would describe the texture, uses, and taste palette of Smears, the fictional insect resembling a blob-fish with worm-like characteristics, in the following manner:

Texture: Smears possess a unique texture that combines elements of softness and slight chewiness. Similar to their blob-fish inspiration, Smears may have a gelatinous or gel-like consistency, making them pliable and yielding to the bite.

Various Uses: Smears can be utilized in a range of culinary applications due to their distinctive texture and flavor. They can be incorporated into both hot and cold dishes, offering versatility in cooking methods such as grilling, frying, or adding to stews, salads, and stir-fries. Smears' texture allows them to absorb flavors and enhance the overall mouthfeel of a dish.

Taste Palette: The taste of Smears can be described as delicate and subtly briny. They may possess a mild umami quality that enhances the overall flavor profile of a dish. The taste of Smears is often influenced by the ingredients and seasonings they are paired with, allowing them to harmonize with various flavors and add depth to the culinary composition.

When preparing dishes with Smears, it is important to consider their texture and flavor as an integral part of the overall composition. They can be used to provide an intriguing textural element, contribute a hint of sea-like essence, or even act as a unique centerpiece in certain culinary creations.

Appetizers/Snacks: Smears could be incorporated into appetizers or snacks such as Smear-infused dips, Smear-stuffed mushrooms, Smear croquettes, or even Smear-flavored popcorn.

Pasta/Risotto: Smears can be utilized in pasta dishes like Smear-infused pasta sauces, Smear-filled ravioli, or Smear-flavored risottos to add an interesting twist to these classic dishes.

Sandwiches/Wraps: Smears could be used as a unique filling or spread in sandwiches or wraps, complementing other ingredients like fresh vegetables, cheeses, or proteins.

Sauces/Condiments: Smears could be transformed into savory sauces or condiments, such as Smear-based vinaigrettes, Smear-infused mayonnaise, or Smear-flavored marinades for meats or vegetables.

Bakery/Desserts: Smears could even find their way into baked goods, such as Smear bread, Smear-filled pastries, Smear-flavored cakes or muffins, or even Smear-infused ice cream or sorbet.
