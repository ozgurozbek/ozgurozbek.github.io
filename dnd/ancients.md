# Ancients

An old civilization that has evolved and found great meaning in both magic and immortality. They made immortality possible and destroyed every meaning they've found within it. With their last magic, they left a warning for future, unfortunately too difficult to grasp, lacking their understanding of magic, life and time. They managed to process light, and believed to achieve a hive-mind society. Nobody knows how they disappeared.

Their offsprings from humans tend to get a disoriented body with partial ancient bodyparts. They live for about 800 years without aging beyond their thirties, body-wise. They are sterile.

## Ancients of Thaum

Their structure Knari Bridge still remains strong. It's path is made from condensed light and almost blinding to look directly.

## Ancients of Teothe

Magical rain on Fireward Desert still remains and the tiny, pond it created shimmers with light. There are also some artifacts long lost in the whole world. Finding them all must be a challenge!

A half ancient woman named Harutya wanders the world looking for the pieces. She has one that she can show. Her ancient body parts allow her to go ethereal while still being able to burn things with the condensed light. She is usually banned from every settlement since she is well known around. She will camp outside and locals usually help her out or listen to her stories.
