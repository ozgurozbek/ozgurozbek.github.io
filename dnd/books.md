### Fisherman Uprising

A stable way of earning wage was every lower class family's wish for their younglings. About a 100 years before the magic crisis, Any kid that was born to a humble family would be encouraged to be a fisherman so they would never worry about starving. And even though that was a wise path to choose until then, it wasn't in that particular time.  

For commoners and peasants who are looking not to waste their precious earnings rather than sleep with a full stomach, fish is the best option to stay relatively full since hunting wild game and growing grain is much much harder in harsh climates such as the lower sides of Wavekeep Sea.

Similar to now, back then fish was every folk's every meal. There were literally plenty of fish in the sea, and plenty of fishermen as well. Being a fisherman paid well, and it was a well respected job. So in overtime the number of fishermen in the Wavekeep Sea grew and grew. Eventually a Fishermen's Guild was formed. The Guild kept the peace among fishermen and even helped out common folk every now and then. The Guild wasn't based in any country, had its own rules and worked with multiple harbours of multiple countries.

Since at the time countries were not exactly in peace terms, more than one party was interested in the fish since eating anything else got harder and harder for the citizens of both countries. although rulers had other worries. Tension between Akairo and Kheranthe was rising. Contact in between was barely existent and both sides were insistent on their terms.

Akairo's problem with the guild started when some members of the guild started to smuggle people in and out of Akairo. When Akairo started to take precautions that affected the Guild's ability to help simple folk in Akairo. Then rulers of Akairo decided to tax the Guild even more to be in their waters. That didn't sit well with the Guild.

The real problem for Akairo began when a drug lord named Junkie Neimann, who is thought to work for the Kheranthe government, bribed some of the fishermen to smuggle opium into Akairo. Its unknown if the Guild knew about this and turned a blind eye, or made profit off of it but many believe that they were not just an innocent bystander. And it was at this time that the war broke between the two countries.

Fishermen were not educated people though, they not only carried opium but also used it. And when the demand for opium increased, so did the amounts of opium carried in a single  ship until the point where fishermen would often not make it to Akairo but choked in opium on the way instead. The rumors got around when highly ranked Guild members started either dying of opium or going insane instead. That caused commoners to lose respect in the Guild. In a short period of time the Guild sank by most members forfeiting their membership and the rest died on opium.

What's left of the guild is few fishermen ships you can spot crewed with opium crazed fishermen-turned-pirates scourging the Wavekeep Sea.

### Mujina Army and the Serpents

Mujina Army was Founded by an ambitious ex soldier named Tywin the Weasel In the Elkian Dominion (287BMC). It's thought he traveled town to town doing odd-jobs, working as a mercenary gathering enough gold to hire a few inexperienced muscles for himself. With each payment he got he hired new muscle, and with each muscle he hired he found new jobs with thicker payment. He wasn't an excellent fighter but he was an excellent teacher. He knew how to turn an inexperienced commoner into a fearsome mercenary. It wasn't until long he built himself a small army numbering up to 400 men.

No mercenary group would ever recruit more than 150-200 soldiers and there is a good reason for that. Chances of getting employed with numbers that high is slim to none because people who need more than 100 people to solve their problems are usually kings, or rulers to that degree, and they usually have soldiers to their name. Tywin knew this very well but he also knew that Akairo never had enough soldiers. He offered his services to the 6 rulers of Akario and immediately got employed by their general.

Mujina Army went from war to war under the Akairo banner. Traveled the continent under the orders of the General. It took time for mercenaries to adjust to the harsher life of the battlefields but they managed. After a dragon problem arised within the Akario soil, rulers ordered the Munija to track and slay the beast. With their numbers still 250 to 300 high, they were confident they could succeed. While they were searching for the beast in the Dyatlov Pass, the beast found them and surprised them with an earthquake attack. Whole pass collapsed on them, creating a huge cavern in the pass with no possible exits. Some of the Mujina got crushed under rocks, dying immediately, rest getting trapped inside the newly created cavern. It took the survivors about 2 months to manage to create an exit. Mujina Army's turn into cannibalism is thought to have happened around this time. Mujina leader, Tywin the Weasel did not survive the cavern. Cause of his death, to this day is still unknown.

Survivors of the Dyatlov Pass got kicked out of the Red Army upon arrival to the mainland. There were about 80 of them left. Mujina Army traveled north, looking for jobs but unable to find so. They set camp near Wukhim. They helped out and worked for free in the city and the nearby settlements. They build themselves a lovely commune. But people and children around the area started to go missing.

Southside Serpents got contracted by various people around the area, relatives of the missing people to find their loved ones. Upon short investigation, Serpents concluded that Mujina Commune was at the root of this problem. One night, Serpents attacked the Commune, killing everyone inside easily.

Unfortunately upon investigation Serpents couldn't find any bone remains of the missing victims. And because Mujina Commune managed to build itself a major reputation around the area no one believed the Serpents that members of the commune were cannibals and abductors. Serpents got shunned by society and did not receive any other contracts. Unable to work under contract or any other place in the area, Serpents changed their appearance. Formed another contractor guild in the city, Slayer's Take, under false identities as new adventurers.

### Khadrick and his bag of lies

***Audience listens to this monologue at a hotel scene in the middle of the forest by a wise, old and grumpy man who has trouble breathing.***

ACT III . SCENE I

Melinda: *Slams the door whlist hurrying inside* Who or what is this Khadrick?

Old Man: Khadrick was the best liar this land ever saw. Before tales about him haunted all the pityful fuckers that care too much about their life I actually knew Khadrick. He used to live in Aesza just like me and my little brother. *He saddens while talking about his brother's passing* I moved from there when my brother's lungs got to him which was actually a few years after Khadrick turned into what he is known for. Now the same disease is haunting me. It has been in our blood for generations.

Melinda: *Nodding slightly, and a bit chilled, sits down the floor*

Old Man: Khadrick was a tiefling and even in the past tieflings weren't trusted people for obvious reasons. That didn't really stop his father from becoming a known bourgeoisie.

Melinda: Burge-huh?

Old Man: *Ignoring the question* Bastard wasn't as nice to his kid as he was to his customers though. In the years I saw him at here and there, poor kid always had bruises. You could tell how much he failed his father by how many new scars he had.

Old Man: Ah **Coughs** *With a weak voice at start slowly recovering that makes the audience understand his lung problems are serious* Aaaah...

Jamison: Are you alright sir?

Old Man: *While rubbing his left knee with his left hand* Sorry, this aged mind and hurting bones distract me from telling a good story. Anyway, what was I saying? Ah.

Old Man: My girlfriend back then, which is my current wife's sister actually, had this tavern that had the ugliest seats in the city but meal was absolutely worth the back pain. Khadrick must've been thinking the same because I saw him there every other day. I often gave him advices about life and he always had his eyes on me when I was making out with Julia which always turned me off.

Melinda: Who wouldn't have...

Jamison: *Under his breath* I wouldn't mind...

Old Man: Now that I think about it, I think it was me who gave him advice about lying to his cunt father. Anyway, eventually the kid started to lie to his father. The father wasn't a dumb fuck either. Since the kid knew he had to lie really carefully and effectively he had to "mastermind" his lies. He sort of achieved it too, I didn't see him with his father's marks after he started to lie except for that one time when a fat and nicely-dressed lady came asking questions to his father. I later learned that, that fat bitch was more than a client to the kid's father. Maybe that time wasn't even Khadrick's fault. Who can tell?

Old Man: That was until his father got killed for a mistake in an illegal shipment he was doing to with a necromancer. Khadrick didn't even know that his father was doing anything illegal and blamed himself for the death of his father. He gave all his attention and respect to ready his father's funeral.

Old Man: **Coughs** *Complains about his lungs by a methapor that includes a demon shitting in his lungs* That was the very reason that this young boy was able to learn the truth about his father's opinions on him. He never gave him any real tasks and was only mocking with him in the shadows. He wanted to show his useless son how much of a disappointment he is. Khadrick decided that his father's codes were just rat shit and wanted to go his own way.

Melinda: I don't think I wouldn't...

Old Man: He lied because of his fear against him and told the truth for a while when he blamed himself for his death. He said to himself **Coughs** *Swears that he will fuck the god who decided to gave him these shitty lungs* He said to himself "from now on I will never tell a single lie, but will only talk to misdirect people." And so he did...

Jamison: I like where this is going. What about the fortune?

Old Man: With all the fortune he had left from his dead "loving" father he was able to gather important information, go to places and every sentence that he designed just fooled people into mistakes. Maybe because there wasn't as many people as shit-eating rats back then, or maybe because that he was a big threat to all humanity Lcaoc himself appeared before him to tell that he WILL stop doing this now and tell the reason why he was doing this to begin with, God was curious because Khadrick hold no hate against any of this people and wasn't enjoying himself while giving others harm.

Old Man: Whatever the **Coughs** whatever the FUCK form was the god in, he hold the man and choked him with anger ordering him to tell the truth. As life was fading away from his breath Khadrick said: "I just wanted you all to feel as played as me and didn't find any comfort at any point for the reason that i never achieved to confuse every single living thing at the same second". God of wit taking his life with bare hands was barbaric and out of character. He was looking at Khadrick's exploded head with anger and disgust and that was when the stupid fucker *He calls the god this way as casually as the audience can imagine* realized that mischievous tiefling played him in death!

Old Man: *Looking at Jamison's and Melinda's puzzled faces* Khadrick was always kind to animals and every other living thing expect humans through his life. He lied to the intelligent god only to make him misjudge "him". This way no one will ever know why the evil bastard gifted everyone lies that were made by the truth and only caused misery. Some people believe that this is just a tale spoken to impress people but i was living in Aesza when poor boy learned the harsh truth about his old man. In fact i might be one of the last people that weren't misguided to their death by the boy since he was "just" deciding to be that evil think in those seconds and weren't as prepared as he was through his journey.

Melinda: Oh that is the rea...

Old Man: Yeah, **coughs** thats why you heard my wife say "I would trust Khadrick before I trust you". That is how much the damn woman hates me after 70 years.

Jamison: Maybe the sister situation didn't help.

Melinda: Why is it a BAG of LIES?

Old Man: Khadrick was known for traveling with his pig skin bag everywhere, not dropping it even when he is sleeping. Fitting, considering this act that he never put down.

END OF ACT III . SCENE I

### Fuck, Marry, Kill

The three paths to a complete life. Accomplishing any of these three feats before you die is noteworthy. But for Bann Jacket, noteworthy just wasn't good enough.

Catching up with Bann was easy as he is now an old, retired elf who spends most of his time in an old handmade rocking chair. We knew that Bann had both fucked and been married because the local affiliate mage showed us a vision of his children and he seemed unhappy. One look in his eyes face to face confirmed the trifecta—this man had definitely taken a life.

Fuck.
As the old man harked back to the days of his sexual peak we found ourselves, cringing. There is just something about an 729-year-old elf recalling his past encounters and using words "slurping", "damp", and "honking" throughout those stories that really made us wonder why we were listening anymore. At one point he rambled about how confusing it can be when you're blindfolded and the woman you're with has an outie belly button. We will spare you the details, just trust us on this one. This guy fucked.

Marry.
Bann has been married to his beautiful, loving wife, Jonda for 237 years. Much to her approval and help, she made several appearances in his stories from the paragraph above. The two have accumulated 11 children over their time together. They married after Bann saw Jonda one evening, before even talking to her he walked right up to her father the next day and asked for her hand in marriage.

Kill.
Bann was exuberant to tell us about all the people he's killed. He spent some time in Seimon Pass but claims the "real fun" happened when he did a brief 30-year stay in Wavekeep Archipelago before Mages Uprising. He explained to us the killings haven't stopped with his old age, they have merely just slowed down. Bann told us he can not stop killing, it's more addicting than heroin. Which he also admitted to doing during his Wavekeep Archipelago stint.
Our time with Bann Jacket has taught us all one thing, legends never die, and they are smarter than the state guards.

### The binding of Lwaro

Mceeju had a terrible foreboding concerning the fate of Lwaro. Lwaro would later kill Raxy during the black rain, the downfall of the cosmos. During this cataclysmic event, escaped souls from Nee, Cepx and Diyp would devour all life and even make Mceeju wake up, the chief of all gods.

Lwaro, daughter of Gud, inspired too much fear in Uke and Veri for them to let him out from under their watchful eyes. Only Gud, the indefatigable upholder of honor, dared to approach Lwaro to feed her.

Lwaro grew at an alarming rate. Knowing well how much devastation she would cause if she were allowed to roam free, the gods attempted to bind her with various chains. Modgo first cursed Lwaro to forever be in the form of a wolf. After this, gods were able to gain the wolf's consent by telling him that these fetters were tests of her strength, and clapping and cheering when, with each new chain they presented her, she broke free.

At last, the gods sent a messenger down to Nhaft "Pjegv in Dwarvish", the realm of the dwarves. The dwarves, being the most skilled craftspeople in the Johke Era, were able to forge a chain whose strength couldn't be equaled; it was wrought from the sound of a cat's footsteps, the smell of music, the roots of mountains, and the breath of a fish - in other words, things which don't exist, and against which it's therefore futile to struggle. Nteud ("Msaoc" in Johke) was the name sung by the dwarvish.

No later with their worries gone, Gods asked Mceeju to grant them another overseer, another guardian, thus reforming Raxy one more time.

### Cfofb, Buib, Pwazo and creation of Fexyiaf

From the dawn of time Buib and Pwazo had a feud between them. Being on the most opposite sides of the spectrum, like death and life and, light and dark, they hated each other, deeply and constantly. Pwazo knowing that Buib had a strong interest in Cfofb, she believed that if her manipulations succeeded she could use Cfofb and overthrow Buib.

In the meantime Buib began thinking that if she could mix her powers with the ones Cfofb posess they could gain a greater power, maybe reaching Mceeju and be the next in line with the all mighty. These thoughts and probably many many more, caused her to be in love with Cfofb.

The goddess of flames, having this eternal hatred towards Buib started to develop expectations from Cfofb over time. After countless arguments her hatred towards Buib grew as well as her expectations from Cfofb. She began to feel love thus starting a competition between herself and Buib. Cfofb knowing nothing about this feud, he missed his chance to maybe stop what was going to happen.

Lwaqy, the god of darkness realized this situation and then harassed both Buib and Pwazo, working behind their backs. Buib being pure, she instantly fell for the traps and soon forgot about her platonic feelings towards Cfofb. Pwazo being fueled with anger couldn't take any more shut-downs and finally forgot about Cfofb after being accepted and taken by Lwaqy. Lwaqy, after having his way with them, told them that the other goddesses was also interested in him. They instantly suspected of one another and the hatred fueled with jealousy sparked again. The feud between Buib and Pwazo caused Fexyiaf to spawn, acting as a container filled with all their hatred and the urge to end one another.

Lwaqy, accepting Fexyiaf as a creation of his own, banished him to his home plane next to Raxy. Buib and Pwazo, finally understanding their mistakes and what they caused, begged the ones associated with life to take back their gift. Uke and Veri declined their cries. Buib and Pwazo then returned to Cfofb and begged acceptance while the god of storms declined them of their powers, giving them the absence of storms when they most needed it. Being this stripped of the power they once longed for, they became closer. They couldn't be near each other without getting mad but they finally understood that, they were the same but in a different path.

### The replacement of Uufh

Msauh, the sage of Johke and the power-seeker, coming after Ecqig and growing with the Lcohwuj was granted great knowledge. He is told that he knew all languages, could speak with and operate all animals and even bargain with the gods.

With all that information he could glimpse into the future. Even with all his great knowledge he couldn't do anything but to watch; as Ecqig was prayed and thanked, acknowledged of his accomplishments and, Lcohwuj being ascended. He was furious but, over time, he understood what he was and what he could do.

As his life neared an ending, he called in a Pedi and asked for a small favor from it. The favor was to see what the other planes looked like. He knew what they were and what was what but he could never see or experience it. Pedi accepted this, thinking a mere human could do no harm but also ate a part of Msauh's soul. Msauh nearing his time, travelled to the Nhaft, plane of dwarves.

He begged an elderly dwarf to forge him a sword benefiting from the weight of all his knowledge and the sharpness of his wit. The dwarf, having a chance like this once in a lifetime forged the blade and gifted it to Msauh.

Msauh used the one way plane to Johke and from there, begged to the god of death Naahv. Gifted him the sword that'll be known afterwards for devouring souls, the "Nahuehak". Naahv, delighted with this gift took Msauh near him and made Fexyiaf test the blade on the strong Lcohwuj, Uufh. This act scarred Msauh since they were once like brothers but deep inside, he wanted to be equal with them. After Uufh's death, a creator god placed Msauh to his position since he knew all the things required and he'd suffer in his once-brother's spot.

### Story of Gaxqaca

For the longest time, Gaxqaca did not know he was a god. His father was a king, the king of the moon, the mighty Wiob.

Wiob loved his little son. But Uke and Veri, Mceeju's creations responsible from all life, hated Gaxqaca. They were very jealous of him since he was born out of like with a blessing from Mceeju himself, just like them, ignoring their purpose of creation. They tried all kinds of ways to kill Gaxqaca, including sending a couple of snakes into his crib and hoping Onposufm would miss and cause a Wefhiza. Gaxqaca crushed those snakes in a flash, with the powers granted from Wiob, overseed by Onposufm and stunning from Vihi. Gaxqaca was incredibly powerful, even as a baby!

Bored from all this attacks, to keep his small son safe, Vihi sent him to live with a mortal family in Johke era. Gaxqaca grew up loved. He married and had a couple of kids. He was happy, but he did not fit in. He was too big, too strong, too different. When outside he was hard to miss, when inside you felt that he was there. With such strong aura, Uke and Veri soon discovered his location.

Tricked by them, Gaxqaca did all kinds of time consuming and pointless things. Some were impossible to accomplish even for gods. He believed Uke and Veri, believed that Wiob and all others were watching him. Gaxqaca used clever tricks and great courage to stay alive and earn his way into the heavens, gaining a remarkable appreciation from all gods good and evil, to take his place with the gods.

### Radu and Nizi

Radu was the god of honor, heroism. Like all gods, he loved drama and contests. His special talent was that he could shape his sense of honor into looking like any thing he wanted. He could shape it into a little mouse or a dangerous animal or a fierce pirate. His favorite shape was that of a handsome young man, dripping in jewels. He had quite the sense of humor.

One day, when Radu was in the form of his favorite shape, a handsome young man, dripping with jewels, he was spotted by some pirates. They thought they had stumbled across a rich prize, someone they could sell for a lot of money as a slave. Laughing cruelly, they grabbed what they thought was a rich young man and carried him off to their pirate ship. They tied him tightly to the mast.

Radu found this all rather amusing. He might have waited a bit longer to see what these stupid mortals would do next, but the rope was rubbing his skin uncomfortably. Radu used his immeasurable strength to push the rope away. It landed in a heap at his feet.

One of the pirates noticed the young man was no longer tied to the mast. The pirate gasped in surprise. He strongly suspected that he and his fellow pirates had made a terrible mistake. This was no ordinary mortal. Things would not go well for them if they did not quickly return the lad to shore. He pleaded with the other pirates to turn the ship about. But they tied Radu to the mast even more tightly than before, with ropes and chains, and headed out to sea.

Radu waited until the ship had reached very deep water. He pushed the ropes off his body. At the same time, he waved his arm, and a thick sword emerged in his hand. Radu shape shifted into a gigantic body and roared. With the splash of his hand to the sea, water emerged, making the ship move and come to a complete halt. He shrink to a normal size and jumped on the terrified pirates. Some jumped overboard to avoid his sharp blade. Soon, the only pirate left alive on board was the pirate who had begged for his release. That pirate would have gladly jumped overboard with his mates, but seeing Radu in awe, his feet were stuck firmly in place. "Is that the island of Muxs?" Radu asked casually, peering ahead.

The pirate nodded, too terrified to speak. "You can drop me off that adxect (Johken word for island) there." Radu decided. The sea calmed down. With no one at the wheel, the ship moved smoothly forward, sailing calmly towards the island of Muxs.

When they arrived at the island, Radu turned into a winged lion and leaped nimbly onto the seawall. He gave the pirate a friendly look and flapped it's wings as in a goodbye, and thus creating a wind that gave the ship a magical shove out to sea.

Laying there, on the island of Muxs, that Radu first saw the lovely Nizi. Abandoned by her parents, Nizi spent her days curled on the seawall, staring out to sea. That day, she was fast asleep, worn out with weeping. She took his breath away, she was that beautiful. She smelled amazing. He transformed onto his self and waited patiently until Nizi opened her eyes. She saw a handsome young man, gazing and admiring at her. Nizi felt better immediately. She told Radu about her efforts to save her brother and the children of Vihi. "And look where it got me." she sniffed.

"You poor thing, " Radu said with great sympathy. So fallen in love he used all of his charm and immediately asked the lovely young Nizi to marry him.

Nizi, no longer feeling forsaken or friendless, and delighted to be admired by this handsome young man, consented to be his wife. After her consent, Radu asked Uke to grant her a blessing. Mceeju hearing this covered them with a warm light and granted that Nizi was the one for Radu, he held Nizi responsible for all things completed and blessed her with the sense of completion. Nizi and Radu still live happily, in love that could even make Vihi, the goddess of love, jealous.

### Wodroh and the magical stick

Once upon a time, a long time ago, Wodroh, the god of murder, was fighting against the Johken in a field in the northernmost tip of the land. He felt that helping Ikvish would make them stronger and then he could have the joy killing them. Wodroh kept a close eye on that field as many battles had been fought there. Wodroh did not wish to miss a good battle. Lcaoc, god of wisdom, saw his half brother, screaming and shouting happily, as the Johken died around him. Lcaoc believed the Johken's cause was just, as they were simply defending their home. He picked up a stick and threw it as hard as he could at Wodroh. Wodroh wasn't paying attention as usual, enjoying the bloodshed. The stick knocked him out cold. When he woke up, the battle was over. The Johken had won! Wodroh never knew it was his brother, Lcaoc, who had knocked him out of the battle!

After that, nobody knows how but somehow, a rumor started that the great god Wodroh had been attacked by a magical twig! Nobody listened to the rumor, nobody that is except two young brothers. The brothers owned the field where battles kept happening. It was very hard to grow crops while men were fighting. The boys had grown tall, manly and strong. The boys quietly collected a huge stack of twigs and sticks, hoping one of them would be the magical one. Their neighbors thought they were building a wall to help protect their field from the wars. Although, they were waiting for Wodroh. They knew Wodroh would show up sooner or later, because Wodroh loved bloodshed, and many a battle had been fought in their field. Wodroh was bound to keep checking. Sure enough, one day, they spotted the great god Wodroh in their field! They threw all what they gathered at him and were very fortunate, since one hit his spine and knocked him out before Wodroh noticed what they were doing. The boys quickly stuffed Wodroh into a huge vase and plugged the top securely.

Wodroh was stuck in that vase for a very long time. And for a very long time, the brothers lived a peaceful life. No battles were fought in their field. Their crops flourished. Their neighbors became their friends. Wodroh might still be in that vase today. Even if he was out, Wodroh never came back to that field, thinking perhaps that the tale of magical twigs were true.

### Creation of Pedi

Lwaqy would constantly come into conflict with Mceeju and after Mceeju withdrew the use of fire by mortals, Lwaqy famously stole the fire and gave it back to humanity. As punishment for his transgressions, he was chained to a star in the sky for eternity. Every day, in the morning, a beam of light (the symbol of Mceeju) would fly towards the star and burn the eyes of Lwaqy. Since he was immortal, his sight would recover, only for the cycle to repeat the next day. Pwazo, out of the burned blood from Lwaqy that is pouring out from his eyes, would then use it to create the Pedi. Later impressed by these creatures would send them to her home plane.

Eventually, Raxcoh freed Lwaqy from his prison.

### Akin and the golden statue

"Hello me. I know, I know it's not my first time seeing you here. You've come here thinking you'd be the savior to those in need huh? Oh what a treat you are going to experience, you have no clue. *How do you know who I am!?* I hear you asking. I am you. I was waiting for you here.

See that crystaly thing there? That'll break next time you arrive here. *How can you...*. I know, because it happened to me, to you. Ah time, flowing like a river. Take that runic, bizarre orb with you. You need it to prolong the inevitable. You need to save others! I know they told you that, evil in this cave must be taken care of, must be turned gold, must be hidden forever. I know all that, it's just, I wish you'd realize that the only evil here is me.

I've already taken what you were meant to take. I took it, turned it to gold, hid it forever. Yet there it is still in front of my golden eyes. There you are, moving into it. Placing your hand on top. *Why shouldn't I destroy it?*. I wish I knew why. I thought the same way. I destroyed it once, and all it did was to make me have visions of me, throughout time and eternity with Lwaqy himself. He spoke to me saying this was what I deserved, what I opted for. I got caught out apparently, signing for a different patron. Oh, it's almost time you touch me.

You smile as you touch my hand. I know, it's cold, I did it before. *Wish I could take you with me.* Me too, maybe one day you could? After you dive into that orb that you are trying to cover with gold. It's going to consume you. You can't say you weren't warned, you've experienced this for... forever times. After you replace me and take my place as the golden statue, take me with you? I failed to do that to me before me. *I want to help all and live my live as a free adventurer!* Hahah, I know. Lwaqy does too though. That small prayer is not going to get you anywhere. Bu I know the answer to your problem. Listen carefully and look into my cold eyes. All you need to be free is to just push me and break me. Then it's just you and you are forever.

I wish you could hear me."
