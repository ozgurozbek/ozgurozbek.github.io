                    <h1>Fishermen Uprising</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>A stable way of earning wage was every lower class family’s wish for their younglings. About a
                        100
                        years
                        before the magic crisis, Any kid that was born to a humble family would be encouraged to be a
                        fisherman
                        so they would never worry about starving. And even though that was a wise path to choose until
                        then,
                        it
                        wasn’t in that particular time.</p>

                    <p>For commoners and peasants who are looking not to waste their precious earnings rather than sleep
                        with a
                        full stomach, fish is the best option to stay relatively full since hunting wild game and
                        growing
                        grain
                        is much much harder in harsh climates such as the lower sides of Wavekeep Sea.</p>

                    <p>Similar to now, back then fish was every folk’s every meal. There were literally plenty of fish
                        in
                        the
                        sea, and plenty of fishermen as well. Being a fisherman paid well, and it was a well respected
                        job.
                        So
                        in overtime the number of fishermen in the Wavekeep Sea grew and grew. Eventually a Fishermen’s
                        Guild
                        was formed. The Guild kept the peace among fishermen and even helped out common folk every now
                        and
                        then.
                        The Guild wasn't based in any country, had its own rules and worked with multiple harbours of
                        multiple
                        countries.</p>

                    <p>Since at the time countries were not exactly in peace terms, more than one party was interested
                        in
                        the
                        fish since eating anything else got harder and harder for the citizens of both countries.
                        although
                        rulers had other worries. Tension between Akairo and Kheranthe was rising. Contact in between
                        was
                        barely
                        existent and both sides were insistent on their terms.</p>

                    <p>Akairo’s problem with the guild started when some members of the guild started to smuggle people
                        in
                        and
                        out of Akairo. When Akairo started to take precautions that affected the Guild’s ability to help
                        simple
                        folk in Akairo. Then rulers of Akairo decided to tax the Guild even more to be in their waters.
                        That
                        didn't sit well with the Guild.</p>

                    <p>The real problem for Akairo began when a drug lord named Junkie Neimann, who is thought to work
                        for
                        the
                        Kheranthe government, bribed some of the fishermen to smuggle opium into Akairo. Its unknown if
                        the
                        Guild knew about this and turned a blind eye, or made profit off of it but many believe that
                        they
                        were
                        not just an innocent bystander. And it was at this time that the war broke between the two
                        countries.</p>

                    <p>Fishermen were not educated people though, they not only carried opium but also used it. And when
                        the
                        demand for opium increased, so did the amounts of opium carried in a single ship until the point
                        where
                        fishermen would often not make it to Akairo but choked in opium on the way instead. The rumors
                        got
                        around when highly ranked Guild members started either dying of opium or going insane instead.
                        That
                        caused commoners to lose respect in the Guild. In a short period of time the Guild sank by most
                        members
                        forfeiting their membership and the rest died on opium.</p>

                    <p>What’s left of the guild is few fishermen ships you can spot crewed with opium crazed
                        fishermen-turned-pirates scourging the Wavekeep Sea.</p>

                    <h1>Mujina Army and the Serpents</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Mujina Army was Founded by an ambitious ex soldier named Tywin the Weasel In the Elkian Dominion
                        (287BMC). It's thought he traveled town to town doing odd-jobs, working as a mercenary gathering
                        enough gold to hire a few inexperienced muscles for himself. With each payment he got he hired
                        new
                        muscle, and with each muscle he hired he found new jobs with thicker payment. He wasn't an
                        excellent
                        fighter but he was an excellent teacher. He knew how to turn an inexperienced commoner into a
                        fearsome mercenary. It wasn't until long he built himself a small army numbering up to 400 men.
                    </p>

                    <p>No mercenary group would ever recruit more than 150-200 soldiers and there is a good reason for
                        that.
                        Chances of getting employed with numbers that high is slim to none because people who need more
                        than
                        100 people to solve their problems are usually kings, or rulers to that degree, and they usually
                        have soldiers to their name. Tywin knew this very well but he also knew that Akairo never had
                        enough
                        soldiers. He offered his services to the 6 rulers of Akario and immediately got employed by
                        their
                        general.</p>

                    <p>Mujina Army went from war to war under the Akairo banner. Traveled the continent under the orders
                        of
                        the General. It took time for mercenaries to adjust to the harsher life of the battlefields but
                        they
                        managed. After a dragon problem arised within the Akario soil, rulers ordered the Munija to
                        track
                        and slay the beast. With their numbers still 250 to 300 high, they were confident they could
                        succeed. While they were searching for the beast in the Dyatlov Pass, the beast found them and
                        surprised them with an earthquake attack. Whole pass collapsed on them, creating a huge cavern
                        in
                        the pass with no possible exits. Some of the Mujina got crushed under rocks, dying immediately,
                        rest
                        getting trapped inside the newly created cavern. It took the survivors about 2 months to manage
                        to
                        create an exit. Mujina Army’s turn into cannibalism is thought to have happened around this
                        time.
                        Mujina leader, Tywin the Weasel did not survive the cavern. Cause of his death, to this day is
                        still
                        unknown.</p>

                    <p>Survivors of the Dyatlov Pass got kicked out of the Red Army upon arrival to the mainland. There
                        were
                        about 80 of them left. Mujina Army traveled north, looking for jobs but unable to find so. They
                        set
                        camp near Wukhim. They helped out and worked for free in the city and the nearby settlements.
                        They
                        build themselves a lovely commune. But people and children around the area started to go
                        missing.</p>

                    <p>Southside Serpents got contracted by various people around the area, relatives of the missing
                        people
                        to find their loved ones. Upon short investigation, Serpents concluded that Mujina Commune was
                        at
                        the root of this problem. One night, Serpents attacked the Commune, killing everyone inside
                        easily.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately upon investigation Serpents couldn't find any bone remains of the missing victims.
                        And
                        because Mujina Commune managed to build itself a major reputation around the area no one
                        believed
                        the Serpents that members of the commune were cannibals and abductors. Serpents got shunned by
                        society and did not receive any other contracts. Unable to work under contract or any other
                        place in
                        the area, Serpents changed their appearance. Formed another contractor guild in the city,
                        Slayer’s
                        Take, under false identities as new adventurers.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>These magically infused clovers seem to pop out of nowhere, and you can think about them while
                        doing things. They help you get better results? Why? HOW? This must be Nepi's doing. By gods, I
                        need more of them!</p>

                    <h1>Fuck, Marry, Kill</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The three paths to a complete life. Accomplishing any of these three feats before you die is
                        noteworthy. But for Bann Jacket, noteworthy just wasn’t good enough.</p>

                    <p>Catching up with Bann was easy as he is now an old, retired elf who spends most of his time in an
                        old handmade rocking chair. We knew that Bann had both fucked and been married because the local
                        affiliate mage showed us a vision of his children and he seemed unhappy. One look in his eyes
                        face to face confirmed the trifecta—this man had definitely taken a life.</p>

                    <p>Fuck.</p>
                    <p>As the old man harked back to the days of his sexual peak we found ourselves, cringing. There is
                        just something about an 729-year-old elf recalling his past encounters and using words
                        "slurping", "damp", and "honking" throughout those stories that really made us wonder why we
                        were listening anymore. At one point he rambled about how confusing it can be when you’re
                        blindfolded and the woman you’re with has an outie belly button. We will spare you the details,
                        just trust us on this one. This guy fucked.</p>

                    <p>Marry.</p>
                    <p>Bann has been married to his beautiful, loving wife, Jonda for 237 years. Much to her approval
                        and help, she made several appearances in his stories from the paragraph above. The two have
                        accumulated 11 children over their time together. They married after Bann saw Jonda one evening,
                        before even talking to her he walked right up to her father the next day and asked for her hand
                        in marriage.</p>

                    <p>Kill.</p>
                    <p>Bann was exuberant to tell us about all the people he’s killed. He spent some time in Seimon Pass
                        but claims the "real fun" happened when he did a brief 30-year stay in Wavekeep Archipelago
                        before Mages Uprising. He explained to us the killings haven’t stopped with his old age, they
                        have merely just slowed down. Bann told us he can not stop killing, it’s more addicting than
                        heroin. Which he also admitted to doing during his Wavekeep Archipelago stint.</p>
                    <p>Our time with Bann Jacket has taught us all one thing, legends never die, and they are smarter
                        than the state guards.</p>

                    <h1>The Binding of Lwaro</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Mceeju had a terrible foreboding concerning the fate of Lwaro. Lwaro would later kill Raxy during
                        the black rain, the downfall of the cosmos. During this cataclysmic event, escaped souls from
                        Nee, Cepx and Diyp would devour all life and even make Mceeju wake up, the chief of all gods.
                    </p>

                    <p>Lwaro, daughter of Gud, inspired too much fear in Uke and Veri for them to let him out from under
                        their watchful eyes. Only Gud, the indefatigable upholder of honor, dared to approach Lwaro to
                        feed her.</p>

                    <p>Lwaro grew at an alarming rate. Knowing well how much devastation she would cause if she were
                        allowed to roam free, the gods attempted to bind her with various chains. Modgo first cursed
                        Lwaro to forever be in the form of a wolf. After this, gods were able to gain the wolf's consent
                        by telling him that these fetters were tests of her strength, and clapping and cheering when,
                        with each new chain they presented her, she broke free.</p>

                    <p>At last, the gods sent a messenger down to Nhaft "Pjegv in Dwarvish", the realm of the dwarves.
                        The dwarves, being the most skilled craftspeople in the Johke Era, were able to forge a chain
                        whose strength couldn't be equaled; it was wrought from the sound of a cat's footsteps, the
                        smell of music, the roots of mountains, and the breath of a fish – in other words, things which
                        don't exist, and against which it's therefore futile to struggle. Nteud ("Msaoc" in Johke) was
                        the name sung by the dwarvish.</p>

                    <p>No later with their worries gone, Gods asked Mceeju to grant them another overseer, another
                        guardian, thus reforming Raxy one more time.</p>

                    <h1>Creation of Fexyiaf</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>From the dawn of time Buib and Pwazo had a feud between them. Being on the most opposite sides of
                        the spectrum, like death and life and, light and dark, they hated each other, deeply and
                        constantly. Pwazo knowing that Buib had a strong interest in Cfofb, she believed that if her
                        manipulations succeeded she could use Cfofb and overthrow Buib.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime Buib began thinking that if she could mix her powers with the ones Cfofb posess
                        they could gain a greater power, maybe reaching Mceeju and be the next in line with the all
                        mighty. These thoughts and probably many many more, caused her to be in love with Cfofb.</p>

                    <p>The goddess of flames, having this eternal hatred towards Buib started to develop expectations
                        from Cfofb over time. After countless arguments her hatred towards Buib grew as well as her
                        expectations from Cfofb. She began to feel love thus starting a competition between herself and
                        Buib. Cfofb knowing nothing about this feud, he missed his chance to maybe stop what was going
                        to happen.</p>

                    <p>Lwaqy, the god of darkness realized this situation and then harassed both Buib and Pwazo, working
                        behind their backs. Buib being pure, she instantly fell for the traps and soon forgot about her
                        platonic feelings towards Cfofb. Pwazo being fueled with anger couldn't take any more shut-downs
                        and finally forgot about Cfofb after being accepted and taken by Lwaqy. Lwaqy, after having his
                        way with them, told them that the other goddesses was also interested in him. They instantly
                        suspected of one another and the hatred fueled with jealousy sparked again. The feud between
                        Buib and Pwazo caused Fexyiaf to spawn, acting as a container filled with all their hatred and
                        the urge to end one another.</p>

                    <p>Lwaqy, accepting Fexyiaf as a creation of his own, banished him to his home plane next to Raxy.
                        Buib and Pwazo, finally understanding their mistakes and what they caused, begged the ones
                        associated with life to take back their gift. Uke and Veri declined their cries. Buib and Pwazo
                        then returned to Cfofb and begged acceptance while the god of storms declined them of their
                        powers, giving them the absence of storms when they most needed it. Being this stripped of the
                        power they once longed for, they became closer. They couldn't be near each other without getting
                        mad but they finally understood that, they were the same but in a different path.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Msauh, the sage of Johke and the power-seeker, coming after Ecqig and growing with the Lcohwuj was granted great knowledge. He is told that he knew all languages, could speak with and operate all animals and even bargain with the gods.</p>

                    <p>With all that information he could glimpse into the future. Even with all his great knowledge he couldn't do anything but to watch; as Ecqig was prayed and thanked, acknowledged of his accomplishments and, Lcohwuj being ascended. He was furious but, over time, he understood what he was and what he could do.</p>
                    
                    <p>As his life neared an ending, he called in a Pedi and asked for a small favor from it. The favor was to see what the other planes looked like. He knew what they were and what was what but he could never see or experience it. Pedi accepted this, thinking a mere human could do no harm but also ate a part of Msauh's soul. Msauh nearing his time, travelled to the Nhaft, plane of dwarves.</p>
                    
                    <p>He begged an elderly dwarf to forge him a sword benefiting from the weight of all his knowledge and the sharpness of his wit. The dwarf, having a chance like this once in a lifetime forged the blade and gifted it to Msauh.</p>
                    
                    <p>Msauh used the one way plane to Johke and from there, begged to the god of death Naahv. Gifted him the sword that'll be known afterwards for devouring souls, the "Nahuehak". Naahv, delighted with this gift took Msauh near him and made Fexyiaf test the blade on the strong Lcohwuj, Uufh. This act scarred Msauh since they were once like brothers but deep inside, he wanted to be equal with them. After Uufh's death, a creator god placed Msauh to his position since he knew all the things required and he'd suffer in his once-brother's spot.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>For the longest time, Gaxqaca did not know he was a god. His father was a king, the king of the moon, the mighty Wiob.</p>

                    <p>Wiob loved his little son. But Uke and Veri, Mceeju's creations responsible from all life, hated Gaxqaca. They were very jealous of him since he was born out of like with a blessing from Mceeju himself, just like them, ignoring their purpose of creation. They tried all kinds of ways to kill Gaxqaca, including sending a couple of snakes into his crib and hoping Onposufm would miss and cause a Wefhiza. Gaxqaca crushed those snakes in a flash, with the powers granted from Wiob, overseed by Onposufm and stunning from Vihi. Gaxqaca was incredibly powerful, even as a baby!</p>

                    <p>Bored from all this attacks, to keep his small son safe, Vihi sent him to live with a mortal family in Johke era. Gaxqaca grew up loved. He married and had a couple of kids. He was happy, but he did not fit in. He was too big, too strong, too different. When outside he was hard to miss, when inside you felt that he was there. With such strong aura, Uke and Veri soon discovered his location.</p>

                    <p>Tricked by them, Gaxqaca did all kinds of time consuming and pointless things. Some were impossible to accomplish even for gods. He believed Uke and Veri, believed that Wiob and all others were watching him. Gaxqaca used clever tricks and great courage to stay alive and earn his way into the heavens, gaining a remarkable appreciation from all gods good and evil, to take his place with the gods.</p>

                    <h1>Radu & Nizi</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Radu was the god of honor, heroism. Like all gods, he loved drama and contests. His special talent was that he could shape his sense of honor into looking like any thing he wanted. He could shape it into a little mouse or a dangerous animal or a fierce pirate. His favorite shape was that of a handsome young man, dripping in jewels. He had quite the sense of humor.</p>

                    <p>One day, when Radu was in the form of his favorite shape, a handsome young man, dripping with jewels, he was spotted by some pirates. They thought they had stumbled across a rich prize, someone they could sell for a lot of money as a slave. Laughing cruelly, they grabbed what they thought was a rich young man and carried him off to their pirate ship. They tied him tightly to the mast.</p>
                    
                    <p>Radu found this all rather amusing. He might have waited a bit longer to see what these stupid mortals would do next, but the rope was rubbing his skin uncomfortably. Radu used his immeasurable strength to push the rope away. It landed in a heap at his feet.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the pirates noticed the young man was no longer tied to the mast. The pirate gasped in surprise. He strongly suspected that he and his fellow pirates had made a terrible mistake. This was no ordinary mortal. Things would not go well for them if they did not quickly return the lad to shore. He pleaded with the other pirates to turn the ship about. But they tied Radu to the mast even more tightly than before, with ropes and chains, and headed out to sea.</p>
                    
                    <p>Radu waited until the ship had reached very deep water. He pushed the ropes off his body. At the same time, he waved his arm, and a thick sword emerged in his hand. Radu shape shifted into a gigantic body and roared. With the splash of his hand to the sea, water emerged, making the ship move and come to a complete halt. He shrink to a normal size and jumped on the terrified pirates. Some jumped overboard to avoid his sharp blade. Soon, the only pirate left alive on board was the pirate who had begged for his release. That pirate would have gladly jumped overboard with his mates, but seeing Radu in awe, his feet were stuck firmly in place. "Is that the island of Muxs?" Radu asked casually, peering ahead.</p>
                    
                    <p>The pirate nodded, too terrified to speak. "You can drop me off that adxect there." Radu decided. The sea calmed down. With no one at the wheel, the ship moved smoothly forward, sailing calmly towards the island of Muxs.</p>
                    
                    <p>When they arrived at the island, Radu turned into a winged lion and leaped nimbly onto the seawall. He gave the pirate a friendly look and flapped it's wings as in a goodbye, and thus creating a wind that gave the ship a magical shove out to sea.</p>
                    
                    <p>Laying there, on the island of Muxs, that Radu first saw the lovely Nizi. Abandoned by her parents, Nizi spent her days curled on the seawall, staring out to sea. That day, she was fast asleep, worn out with weeping. She took his breath away, she was that beautiful. She smelled amazing. He transformed onto his self and waited patiently until Nizi opened her eyes. She saw a handsome young man, gazing and admiring at her. Nizi felt better immediately. She told Radu about her efforts to save her brother and the children of Vihi. "And look where it got me." she sniffed.</p>
                    
                    <p>"You poor thing, " Radu said with great sympathy. So fallen in love he used all of his charm and immediately asked the lovely young Nizi to marry him.
                   </p> 
                    <p>Nizi, no longer feeling forsaken or friendless, and delighted to be admired by this handsome young man, consented to be his wife. After her consent, Radu asked Uke to grant her a blessing. Mceeju hearing this covered them with a warm light and granted that Nizi was the one for Radu, he held Nizi responsible for all things completed and blessed her with the sense of completion. Nizi and Radu still live happily, in love that could even make Vihi, the goddess of love, jealous.</p>

                    <h1>The Magical Stick</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, Wodroh, the god of murder, was fighting against the Johken in a field in the northernmost tip of the land. He felt that helping Ikvish would make them stronger and then he could have the joy killing them. Wodroh kept a close eye on that field as many battles had been fought there. Wodroh did not wish to miss a good battle. Lcaoc, god of wisdom, saw his half brother, screaming and shouting happily, as the Johken died around him. Lcaoc believed the Johken's cause was just, as they were simply defending their home. He picked up a stick and threw it as hard as he could at Wodroh. Wodroh wasn't paying attention as usual, enjoying the bloodshed. The stick knocked him out cold. When he woke up, the battle was over. The Johken had won! Wodroh never knew it was his brother, Lcaoc, who had knocked him out of the battle!</p>

                    <p>After that, nobody knows how but somehow, a rumor started that the great god Wodroh had been attacked by a magical twig! Nobody listened to the rumor, nobody that is except two young brothers. The brothers owned the field where battles kept happening. It was very hard to grow crops while men were fighting. The boys had grown tall, manly and strong. The boys quietly collected a huge stack of twigs and sticks, hoping one of them would be the magical one. Their neighbors thought they were building a wall to help protect their field from the wars. Although, they were waiting for Wodroh. They knew Wodroh would show up sooner or later, because Wodroh loved bloodshed, and many a battle had been fought in their field. Wodroh was bound to keep checking. Sure enough, one day, they spotted the great god Wodroh in their field! They threw all what they gathered at him and were very fortunate, since one hit his spine and knocked him out before Wodroh noticed what they were doing. The boys quickly stuffed Wodroh into a huge vase and plugged the top securely.</p>
                    
                    <p>Wodroh was stuck in that vase for a very long time. And for a very long time, the brothers lived a peaceful life. No battles were fought in their field. Their crops flourished. Their neighbors became their friends. Wodroh might still be in that vase today. Even if he was out, Wodroh never came back to that field, thinking perhaps that the tale of magical twigs were true.</p>

As punishment for his transgressions, he was chained to a star in the sky for eternity. Every day, in the morning, a beam of light (the symbol of Mceeju) would fly towards the star and burn the eyes of Lwaqy. Since he was immortal, his sight would recover, only for the cycle to repeat the next day. Out of his burned blood, pouring from his eyes would create the Pedi. Lwaqy impressed by these creatures would send them to his home plane.</p>

                    <p>Eventually, Raxcoh freed Lwaqy from his prison.</p>

Oh what a treat you are going to experience, you have no clue. *How do you know who I am!?* I hear you asking. I am you. I was waiting for you here.</p>

                    <p>See that crystaly thing there? That'll break next time you arrive here. *How can you...*. I know, because it happened to me, to you. Ah time, flowing like a river. Take that runic, bizarre orb with you. You need it to prolong the inevitable. You need to save others! I know they told you that, evil in this cave must be taken care of, must be turned gold, must be hidden forever. I know all that, it's just, I wish you'd realize that the only evil here is me.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've already taken what you were meant to take. I took it, turned it to gold, hid it forever. Yet there it is still in front of my golden eyes. There you are, moving into it. Placing your hand on top. *Why shouldn't I destroy it?*. I wish I knew why. I thought the same way. I destroyed it once, and all it did was to make me have visions of me, throughout time and eternity with Lwaqy himself. He spoke to me saying this was what I deserved, what I opted for. I got caught out apparently, signing for a different patron. Oh, it's almost time you touch me.</p>
                    
                    <p>You smile as you touch my hand. I know, it's cold, I did it before. *Wish I could take you with me.* Me too, maybe one day you could? After you dive into that orb that you are trying to cover with gold. It's going to consume you. You can't say you weren't warned, you've experienced this for... forever times. After you replace me and take my place as the golden statue, take me with you? I failed to do that to me before me. *I want to help all and live my live as a free adventurer!* Hahah, I know. Lwaqy does too though. That small prayer is not going to get you anywhere. Bu I know the answer to your problem. Listen carefully and look into my cold eyes. All you need to be free is to just push me and break me. Then it's just you and you are forever.</p>

                    <p>You want to visit the underdark huh? It is similar to our home, but different in a way that troubles most souls that venture there. Slavers and slaves, drow and duergar fill this place. The vast, multilayered underworld that imitates our home. Always cold with a dry air, never feeling the sunlight and the wind. There are ways to go in and die there.</p>

                    <p>On your travels, without stars and a proper navigation, your way will be lit with bioluminescent fungi and glowstone. If the path is dark, you are surrounded with darkrock. You may be surprised to see old bridges and destroyed buildings but remember, these lands are full of life. That wood you see, is not actually wood. Lumber like fungus and carved stalagmites are used for them, and they are weak or sharp. Settling down below the caves, in the caves, underground magma rivers.</p>
                    
                    <p>This brief introduction may cause you to avoid this place, and you should. Scholars and brave men, listen to my words. There are grave dangers and a different pool of magic here. Faerzress.</p>
                    
                    <p>Many cities are built where Faerzress is little to protect their cities. It messes with your spells. Races below also have gear for this wild magic. They make items, gear, and wage war against each other using this. Although threat doesn't even begin there. Purple worms, umberhulks, zornns, Kuo-Toa and other lurk in the Underdark. You will be incredibly lucky to find a recent map, if there is even any. I have the overall map that I came across, distributed in these series, and have high doubts that it will ever change.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Greetings adventurers to the second iteration. I'll be talking about how The Underdark's layers work on this section. Reminding you that water is so scarce and fresh water is hoarded and protected, some of my many gear, including notes have been traded with the natives of Underdark. Interesting fact that, they use Electrum over there instead of gold. I managed to struck a bargain by getting an electrum piece per 2 gold pieces.</p>

                    <p>The upperdark as they call it, underdark for children as I call it. Drow outposts and small settlements take place here. They are usually near the tunnels that are really wide, strong and old. Some of these tunnels may even go all the way up, to home. The main Deep Gnome Population also live here as well as some underground dangers like stone giants. Here, you can eat and eat and eat. You may even want to put on some weight since you'll be needing it as we descend further. </p>
                    
                    <p>Welcome to the middledark. Miles deep and huge, most visited and inhabited area with bigger cities and bigger monsters. Beware that even though most of you still reading this will end up here, underdark is never a friend. Some Illithids even travel in groups here, with a beholder here and there. Illithids eat brains, beholders eat.. well, I don't even know if that floating eye-ball has a mouth.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we descent further, we should arrive at the lowerdark. I've never been here, and never met anyone who dares to enter here. While most of the Underdark is massive caverns, glowing mushrooms, stone cities, dark lakes, long tunnels, hungry everything, stale air, barren mazes, toxic spores, ooze, lava, darkness, maddening silence, Lowerdark is where this all actively seek out for your death. There is also little to no food, so if your portal ended up in the lowerdark, hopefully you'll realize and hurry back.</p>
                    
                    <p>The one thing you don't want to come across here, and run as fast as you can dropping any ties you had, are the aboleths. Old gods of the olden times, rulers of the worlds…</p>

                    <p>If you are still reading this book series, I'll keep it information only, since you must be determined to die. Let's talk about Faerzress. It is a constant radiation of magic. A magic force that protects from receiving visions from different places, alters spells, limits teleportation and feeds plants. That is why the mushrooms are abundant, and moss still grows even in the absence of the sun. Yes you read that right, the condensed energy is a rival to our sun.</p>

                    <p>There are also small places that resemble a different world or so unique called The Undergroves. These can be the difference between your death and survival. I've only come across one, and it is called as the Barnacle Fields by the gnomes. Cavernous area, large craters. Their hard shell makes them really difficult to kill but has good meat if you can manage it. Be careful to cook it well to avoid fungus infection. Do not stand on their mouth. Never a good idea.</p>
                    
                    <p>After learning all this information, I can only hope that you don't die and come back to tell a story. Maybe, you can advance the knowledge provided by this book, or completely destroy the nonsense that is written here, if it is actually a nonsense then. Seek out the fourth volume for a map and gear recommendations which I believe to be essential to my return. Good luck adventurers.</p>

                    <p>The items I have used are as follows. These are a must, in my humble opinion. A lizard leather breathing hood for spore infested caverns or gaseous chambers. A climbing kit is since stalagmites, purple worm tunnels, pits, volcanic tubes, vertical shafts and many other terrain is extremely dangerous and hard to traverse through. Monsters wont wait for you so a spider kit and stoneburner gloves are really good. Potion bladder is also proved itself useful because you are definitely going to need potions. Running and fighting happened a lot, but if need be, a mister could be used for a more stealthy approach.</p>

                    <p>Best of luck to you, don't die.</p>
