                    <h1>Fishermen Uprising</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>A stable way of earning wage was every lower class family’s wish for their younglings. About a
                        100
                        years
                        before the magic crisis, Any kid that was born to a humble family would be encouraged to be a
                        fisherman
                        so they would never worry about starving. And even though that was a wise path to choose until
                        then,
                        it
                        wasn’t in that particular time.</p>

                    <p>For commoners and peasants who are looking not to waste their precious earnings rather than sleep
                        with a
                        full stomach, fish is the best option to stay relatively full since hunting wild game and
                        growing
                        grain
                        is much much harder in harsh climates such as the lower sides of Wavekeep Sea.</p>

                    <p>Similar to now, back then fish was every folk’s every meal. There were literally plenty of fish
                        in
                        the
                        sea, and plenty of fishermen as well. Being a fisherman paid well, and it was a well respected
                        job.
                        So
                        in overtime the number of fishermen in the Wavekeep Sea grew and grew. Eventually a Fishermen’s
                        Guild
                        was formed. The Guild kept the peace among fishermen and even helped out common folk every now
                        and
                        then.
                        The Guild wasn't based in any country, had its own rules and worked with multiple harbours of
                        multiple
                        countries.</p>

                    <p>Since at the time countries were not exactly in peace terms, more than one party was interested
                        in
                        the
                        fish since eating anything else got harder and harder for the citizens of both countries.
                        although
                        rulers had other worries. Tension between Akairo and Kheranthe was rising. Contact in between
                        was
                        barely
                        existent and both sides were insistent on their terms.</p>

                    <p>Akairo’s problem with the guild started when some members of the guild started to smuggle people
                        in
                        and
                        out of Akairo. When Akairo started to take precautions that affected the Guild’s ability to help
                        simple
                        folk in Akairo. Then rulers of Akairo decided to tax the Guild even more to be in their waters.
                        That
                        didn't sit well with the Guild.</p>

                    <p>The real problem for Akairo began when a drug lord named Junkie Neimann, who is thought to work
                        for
                        the
                        Kheranthe government, bribed some of the fishermen to smuggle opium into Akairo. Its unknown if
                        the
                        Guild knew about this and turned a blind eye, or made profit off of it but many believe that
                        they
                        were
                        not just an innocent bystander. And it was at this time that the war broke between the two
                        countries.</p>

                    <p>Fishermen were not educated people though, they not only carried opium but also used it. And when
                        the
                        demand for opium increased, so did the amounts of opium carried in a single ship until the point
                        where
                        fishermen would often not make it to Akairo but choked in opium on the way instead. The rumors
                        got
                        around when highly ranked Guild members started either dying of opium or going insane instead.
                        That
                        caused commoners to lose respect in the Guild. In a short period of time the Guild sank by most
                        members
                        forfeiting their membership and the rest died on opium.</p>

                    <p>What’s left of the guild is few fishermen ships you can spot crewed with opium crazed
                        fishermen-turned-pirates scourging the Wavekeep Sea.</p>

                <section id="2">
                    <h1>Mujina Army and the Serpents</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Mujina Army was Founded by an ambitious ex soldier named Tywin the Weasel In the Elkian Dominion
                        (287BMC). It's thought he traveled town to town doing odd-jobs, working as a mercenary gathering
                        enough gold to hire a few inexperienced muscles for himself. With each payment he got he hired
                        new
                        muscle, and with each muscle he hired he found new jobs with thicker payment. He wasn't an
                        excellent
                        fighter but he was an excellent teacher. He knew how to turn an inexperienced commoner into a
                        fearsome mercenary. It wasn't until long he built himself a small army numbering up to 400 men.
                    </p>

                    <p>No mercenary group would ever recruit more than 150-200 soldiers and there is a good reason for
                        that.
                        Chances of getting employed with numbers that high is slim to none because people who need more
                        than
                        100 people to solve their problems are usually kings, or rulers to that degree, and they usually
                        have soldiers to their name. Tywin knew this very well but he also knew that Akairo never had
                        enough
                        soldiers. He offered his services to the 6 rulers of Akario and immediately got employed by
                        their
                        general.</p>

                    <p>Mujina Army went from war to war under the Akairo banner. Traveled the continent under the orders
                        of
                        the General. It took time for mercenaries to adjust to the harsher life of the battlefields but
                        they
                        managed. After a dragon problem arised within the Akario soil, rulers ordered the Munija to
                        track
                        and slay the beast. With their numbers still 250 to 300 high, they were confident they could
                        succeed. While they were searching for the beast in the Dyatlov Pass, the beast found them and
                        surprised them with an earthquake attack. Whole pass collapsed on them, creating a huge cavern
                        in
                        the pass with no possible exits. Some of the Mujina got crushed under rocks, dying immediately,
                        rest
                        getting trapped inside the newly created cavern. It took the survivors about 2 months to manage
                        to
                        create an exit. Mujina Army’s turn into cannibalism is thought to have happened around this
                        time.
                        Mujina leader, Tywin the Weasel did not survive the cavern. Cause of his death, to this day is
                        still
                        unknown.</p>

                    <p>Survivors of the Dyatlov Pass got kicked out of the Red Army upon arrival to the mainland. There
                        were
                        about 80 of them left. Mujina Army traveled north, looking for jobs but unable to find so. They
                        set
                        camp near Wukhim. They helped out and worked for free in the city and the nearby settlements.
                        They
                        build themselves a lovely commune. But people and children around the area started to go
                        missing.</p>

                    <p>Southside Serpents got contracted by various people around the area, relatives of the missing
                        people
                        to find their loved ones. Upon short investigation, Serpents concluded that Mujina Commune was
                        at
                        the root of this problem. One night, Serpents attacked the Commune, killing everyone inside
                        easily.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately upon investigation Serpents couldn't find any bone remains of the missing victims.
                        And
                        because Mujina Commune managed to build itself a major reputation around the area no one
                        believed
                        the Serpents that members of the commune were cannibals and abductors. Serpents got shunned by
                        society and did not receive any other contracts. Unable to work under contract or any other
                        place in
                        the area, Serpents changed their appearance. Formed another contractor guild in the city,
                        Slayer’s
                        Take, under false identities as new adventurers.</p>

                    <h1>What are these clovers?</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>These magically infused clovers seem to pop out of nowhere, and you can think about them while
                        doing things. They help you get better results? Why? HOW? This must be Nepi's doing. By gods, I
                        need more of them!</p>
                </section>

                <section id="4">
                    <h1>Fuck, Marry, Kill</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The three paths to a complete life. Accomplishing any of these three feats before you die is
                        noteworthy. But for Bann Jacket, noteworthy just wasn’t good enough.</p>

                    <p>Catching up with Bann was easy as he is now an old, retired elf who spends most of his time in an
                        old handmade rocking chair. We knew that Bann had both fucked and been married because the local
                        affiliate mage showed us a vision of his children and he seemed unhappy. One look in his eyes
                        face to face confirmed the trifecta—this man had definitely taken a life.</p>

                    <p>Fuck.</p>
                    <p>As the old man harked back to the days of his sexual peak we found ourselves, cringing. There is
                        just something about an 729-year-old elf recalling his past encounters and using words
                        "slurping", "damp", and "honking" throughout those stories that really made us wonder why we
                        were listening anymore. At one point he rambled about how confusing it can be when you’re
                        blindfolded and the woman you’re with has an outie belly button. We will spare you the details,
                        just trust us on this one. This guy fucked.</p>

                    <p>Marry.</p>
                    <p>Bann has been married to his beautiful, loving wife, Jonda for 237 years. Much to her approval
                        and help, she made several appearances in his stories from the paragraph above. The two have
                        accumulated 11 children over their time together. They married after Bann saw Jonda one evening,
                        before even talking to her he walked right up to her father the next day and asked for her hand
                        in marriage.</p>

                    <p>Kill.</p>
                    <p>Bann was exuberant to tell us about all the people he’s killed. He spent some time in Seimon Pass
                        but claims the "real fun" happened when he did a brief 30-year stay in Wavekeep Archipelago
                        before Mages Uprising. He explained to us the killings haven’t stopped with his old age, they
                        have merely just slowed down. Bann told us he can not stop killing, it’s more addicting than
                        heroin. Which he also admitted to doing during his Wavekeep Archipelago stint.</p>
                    <p>Our time with Bann Jacket has taught us all one thing, legends never die, and they are smarter
                        than the state guards.</p>

                    <h1>The Binding of Lwaro</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Mceeju had a terrible foreboding concerning the fate of Lwaro. Lwaro would later kill Raxy during
                        the black rain, the downfall of the cosmos. During this cataclysmic event, escaped souls from
                        Nee, Cepx and Diyp would devour all life and even make Mceeju wake up, the chief of all gods.
                    </p>

                    <p>Lwaro, daughter of Gud, inspired too much fear in Uke and Veri for them to let him out from under
                        their watchful eyes. Only Gud, the indefatigable upholder of honor, dared to approach Lwaro to
                        feed her.</p>

                    <p>Lwaro grew at an alarming rate. Knowing well how much devastation she would cause if she were
                        allowed to roam free, the gods attempted to bind her with various chains. Modgo first cursed
                        Lwaro to forever be in the form of a wolf. After this, gods were able to gain the wolf's consent
                        by telling him that these fetters were tests of her strength, and clapping and cheering when,
                        with each new chain they presented her, she broke free.</p>

                    <p>At last, the gods sent a messenger down to Nhaft "Pjegv in Dwarvish", the realm of the dwarves.
                        The dwarves, being the most skilled craftspeople in the Johke Era, were able to forge a chain
                        whose strength couldn't be equaled; it was wrought from the sound of a cat's footsteps, the
                        smell of music, the roots of mountains, and the breath of a fish – in other words, things which
                        don't exist, and against which it's therefore futile to struggle. Nteud ("Msaoc" in Johke) was
                        the name sung by the dwarvish.</p>

                    <p>No later with their worries gone, Gods asked Mceeju to grant them another overseer, another
                        guardian, thus reforming Raxy one more time.</p>

                    <h1>Creation of Fexyiaf</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>From the dawn of time Buib and Pwazo had a feud between them. Being on the most opposite sides of
                        the spectrum, like death and life and, light and dark, they hated each other, deeply and
                        constantly. Pwazo knowing that Buib had a strong interest in Cfofb, she believed that if her
                        manipulations succeeded she could use Cfofb and overthrow Buib.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime Buib began thinking that if she could mix her powers with the ones Cfofb posess
                        they could gain a greater power, maybe reaching Mceeju and be the next in line with the all
                        mighty. These thoughts and probably many many more, caused her to be in love with Cfofb.</p>

                    <p>The goddess of flames, having this eternal hatred towards Buib started to develop expectations
                        from Cfofb over time. After countless arguments her hatred towards Buib grew as well as her
                        expectations from Cfofb. She began to feel love thus starting a competition between herself and
                        Buib. Cfofb knowing nothing about this feud, he missed his chance to maybe stop what was going
                        to happen.</p>

                    <p>Lwaqy, the god of darkness realized this situation and then harassed both Buib and Pwazo, working
                        behind their backs. Buib being pure, she instantly fell for the traps and soon forgot about her
                        platonic feelings towards Cfofb. Pwazo being fueled with anger couldn't take any more shut-downs
                        and finally forgot about Cfofb after being accepted and taken by Lwaqy. Lwaqy, after having his
                        way with them, told them that the other goddesses was also interested in him. They instantly
                        suspected of one another and the hatred fueled with jealousy sparked again. The feud between
                        Buib and Pwazo caused Fexyiaf to spawn, acting as a container filled with all their hatred and
                        the urge to end one another.</p>

                    <p>Lwaqy, accepting Fexyiaf as a creation of his own, banished him to his home plane next to Raxy.
                        Buib and Pwazo, finally understanding their mistakes and what they caused, begged the ones
                        associated with life to take back their gift. Uke and Veri declined their cries. Buib and Pwazo
                        then returned to Cfofb and begged acceptance while the god of storms declined them of their
                        powers, giving them the absence of storms when they most needed it. Being this stripped of the
                        power they once longed for, they became closer. They couldn't be near each other without getting
                        mad but they finally understood that, they were the same but in a different path.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Msauh, the sage of Johke and the power-seeker, coming after Ecqig and growing with the Lcohwuj
                        was granted great knowledge. He is told that he knew all languages, could speak with and operate
                        all animals and even bargain with the gods.</p>
                    <p>With all that information he could glimpse into the future. Even with all his great knowledge he
                        couldn't do anything but to watch; as Ecqig was prayed and thanked, acknowledged of his
                        accomplishments and, Lcohwuj being ascended. He was furious but, over time, he understood what
                        he was and what he could do.</p>
                    <p>As his life neared an ending, he called in a Pedi and asked for a small favor from it. The favor
                        was to see what the other planes looked like. He knew what they were and what was what but he
                        could never see or experience it. Pedi accepted this, thinking a mere human could do no harm but
                        also ate a part of Msauh's soul. Msauh nearing his time, travelled to the Nhaft, plane of
                        dwarves.</p>
                    <p>He begged an elderly dwarf to forge him a sword benefiting from the weight of all his knowledge
                        and the sharpness of his wit. The dwarf, having a chance like this once in a lifetime forged the
                        blade and gifted it to Msauh.</p>
                    <p>Msauh used the one way plane to Johke and from there, begged to the god of death Naahv. Gifted
                        him the sword that'll be known afterwards for devouring souls, the "Nahuehak". Naahv, delighted
                        with this gift took Msauh near him and made Fexyiaf test the blade on the strong Lcohwuj, Uufh.
                        This act scarred Msauh since they were once like brothers but deep inside, he wanted to be equal
                        with them. After Uufh's death, a creator god placed Msauh to his position since he knew all the
                        things required and he'd suffer in his once-brother's spot.</p>

                    <h1>Story of Gaxcaqa</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>For the longest time, Gaxqaca did not know he was a god. His father was a king, the king of the
                        moon, the mighty Wiob.</p>
                    <p>Wiob loved his little son. But Uke and Veri, Mceeju's creations responsible from all life, hated
                        Gaxqaca. They were very jealous of him since he was born out of like with a blessing from Mceeju
                        himself, just like them, ignoring their purpose of creation. They tried all kinds of ways to
                        kill Gaxqaca, including sending a couple of snakes into his crib and hoping Onposufm would miss
                        and cause a Wefhiza. Gaxqaca crushed those snakes in a flash, with the powers granted from Wiob,
                        overseed by Onposufm and stunning from Vihi. Gaxqaca was incredibly powerful, even as a baby!
                    </p>
                    <p>Bored from all this attacks, to keep his small son safe, Vihi sent him to live with a mortal
                        family in Johke era. Gaxqaca grew up loved. He married and had a couple of kids. He was happy,
                        but he did not fit in. He was too big, too strong, too different. When outside he was hard to
                        miss, when inside you felt that he was there. With such strong aura, Uke and Veri soon
                        discovered his location.</p>
                    <p>Tricked by them, Gaxqaca did all kinds of time consuming and pointless things. Some were
                        impossible to accomplish even for gods. He believed Uke and Veri, believed that Wiob and all
                        others were watching him. Gaxqaca used clever tricks and great courage to stay alive and earn
                        his way into the heavens, gaining a remarkable appreciation from all gods good and evil, to take
                        his place with the gods.</p>

                    <h1>Radu & Nizi</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Radu was the god of honor, heroism. Like all gods, he loved drama and contests. His special
                        talent was that he could shape his sense of honor into looking like any thing he wanted. He
                        could shape it into a little mouse or a dangerous animal or a fierce pirate. His favorite shape
                        was that of a handsome young man, dripping in jewels. He had quite the sense of humor.</p>
                    <p>One day, when Radu was in the form of his favorite shape, a handsome young man, dripping with
                        jewels, he was spotted by some pirates. They thought they had stumbled across a rich prize,
                        someone they could sell for a lot of money as a slave. Laughing cruelly, they grabbed what they
                        thought was a rich young man and carried him off to their pirate ship. They tied him tightly to
                        the mast.</p>
                    <p>Radu found this all rather amusing. He might have waited a bit longer to see what these stupid
                        mortals would do next, but the rope was rubbing his skin uncomfortably. Radu used his
                        immeasurable strength to push the rope away. It landed in a heap at his feet.</p>
                    <p>One of the pirates noticed the young man was no longer tied to the mast. The pirate gasped in
                        surprise. He strongly suspected that he and his fellow pirates had made a terrible mistake. This
                        was no ordinary mortal. Things would not go well for them if they did not quickly return the lad
                        to shore. He pleaded with the other pirates to turn the ship about. But they tied Radu to the
                        mast even more tightly than before, with ropes and chains, and headed out to sea.</p>
                    <p>Radu waited until the ship had reached very deep water. He pushed the ropes off his body. At the
                        same time, he waved his arm, and a thick sword emerged in his hand. Radu shape shifted into a
                        gigantic body and roared. With the splash of his hand to the sea, water emerged, making the ship
                        move and come to a complete halt. He shrink to a normal size and jumped on the terrified
                        pirates. Some jumped overboard to avoid his sharp blade. Soon, the only pirate left alive on
                        board was the pirate who had begged for his release. That pirate would have gladly jumped
                        overboard with his mates, but seeing Radu in awe, his feet were stuck firmly in place. "Is that
                        the island of Muxs?" Radu asked casually, peering ahead.</p>
                    <p>The pirate nodded, too terrified to speak. "You can drop me off that adxect there." Radu decided.
                        The sea calmed down. With no one at the wheel, the ship moved smoothly forward, sailing calmly
                        towards the island of Muxs.</p>
                    <p>When they arrived at the island, Radu turned into a winged lion and leaped nimbly onto the
                        seawall. He gave the pirate a friendly look and flapped it's wings as in a goodbye, and thus
                        creating a wind that gave the ship a magical shove out to sea.</p>
                    <p>Laying there, on the island of Muxs, that Radu first saw the lovely Nizi. Abandoned by her
                        parents, Nizi spent her days curled on the seawall, staring out to sea. That day, she was fast
                        asleep, worn out with weeping. She took his breath away, she was that beautiful. She smelled
                        amazing. He transformed onto his self and waited patiently until Nizi opened her eyes. She saw a
                        handsome young man, gazing and admiring at her. Nizi felt better immediately. She told Radu
                        about her efforts to save her brother and the children of Vihi. "And look where it got me." she
                        sniffed.</p>
                    <p>"You poor thing, " Radu said with great sympathy. So fallen in love he used all of his charm and
                        immediately asked the lovely young Nizi to marry him.</p>
                    <p>Nizi, no longer feeling forsaken or friendless, and delighted to be admired by this handsome
                        young man, consented to be his wife. After her consent, Radu asked Uke to grant her a blessing.
                        Mceeju hearing this covered them with a warm light and granted that Nizi was the one for Radu,
                        he held Nizi responsible for all things completed and blessed her with the sense of completion.
                        Nizi and Radu still live happily, in love that could even make Vihi, the goddess of love,
                        jealous.</p>

                    <h1>The Magical Stick</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, Wodroh, the god of murder, was fighting against the Johken in
                        a field in the northernmost tip of the land. He felt that helping Ikvish would make them
                        stronger and then he could have the joy killing them. Wodroh kept a close eye on that field as
                        many battles had been fought there. Wodroh did not wish to miss a good battle. Lcaoc, god of
                        wisdom, saw his half brother, screaming and shouting happily, as the Johken died around him.
                        Lcaoc believed the Johken's cause was just, as they were simply defending their home. He picked
                        up a stick and threw it as hard as he could at Wodroh. Wodroh wasn't paying attention as usual,
                        enjoying the bloodshed. The stick knocked him out cold. When he woke up, the battle was over.
                        The Johken had won! Wodroh never knew it was his brother, Lcaoc, who had knocked him out of the
                        battle!</p>
                    <p>After that, nobody knows how but somehow, a rumor started that the great god Wodroh had been
                        attacked by a magical twig! Nobody listened to the rumor, nobody that is except two young
                        brothers. The brothers owned the field where battles kept happening. It was very hard to grow
                        crops while men were fighting. The boys had grown tall, manly and strong. The boys quietly
                        collected a huge stack of twigs and sticks, hoping one of them would be the magical one. Their
                        neighbors thought they were building a wall to help protect their field from the wars. Although,
                        they were waiting for Wodroh. They knew Wodroh would show up sooner or later, because Wodroh
                        loved bloodshed, and many a battle had been fought in their field. Wodroh was bound to keep
                        checking. Sure enough, one day, they spotted the great god Wodroh in their field! They threw all
                        what they gathered at him and were very fortunate, since one hit his spine and knocked him out
                        before Wodroh noticed what they were doing. The boys quickly stuffed Wodroh into a huge vase and
                        plugged the top securely.</p>
                    <p>Wodroh was stuck in that vase for a very long time. And for a very long time, the brothers lived
                        a peaceful life. No battles were fought in their field. Their crops flourished. Their neighbors
                        became their friends. Wodroh might still be in that vase today. Even if he was out, Wodroh never
                        came back to that field, thinking perhaps that the tale of magical twigs were true.</p>

                        by mortals, Lwaqy famously stole the fire and gave it back to humanity. As punishment for his
                        transgressions, he was chained to a star in the sky for eternity. Every day, in the morning, a
                        beam of light (the symbol of Mceeju) would fly towards the star and burn the eyes of Lwaqy.
                        Since he was immortal, his sight would recover, only for the cycle to repeat the next day. Out
                        of his burned blood, pouring from his eyes would create the Pedi. Lwaqy impressed by these

                        there it is still in front of my golden eyes. There you are, moving into it. Placing your hand
                        on top. *Why shouldn't I destroy it?*. I wish I knew why. I thought the same way. I destroyed it
                        once, and all it did was to make me have visions of me, throughout time and eternity with Lwaqy
                        himself. He spoke to me saying this was what I deserved, what I opted for. I got caught out
                        apparently, signing for a different patron. Oh, it's almost time you touch me.</p>
                    <p>You smile as you touch my hand. I know, it's cold, I did it before. *Wish I could take you with
                        me.* Me too, maybe one day you could? After you dive into that orb that you are trying to cover
                        with gold. It's going to consume you. You can't say you weren't warned, you've experienced this
                        for... forever times. After you replace me and take my place as the golden statue, take me with
                        you? I failed to do that to me before me. *I want to help all and live my live as a free
                        adventurer!* Hahah, I know. Lwaqy does too though. That small prayer is not going to get you
                        anywhere. Bu I know the answer to your problem. Listen carefully and look into my cold eyes. All
                        you need to be free is to just push me and break me. Then it's just you and you are forever.</p>
                    <p>I wish you could hear me."</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>You want to visit the underdark huh? It is similar to our home, but different in a way that
                        troubles most souls that venture there. Slavers and slaves, drow and duergar fill this place.
                        The vast, multilayered underworld that imitates our home. Always cold with a dry air, never
                        feeling the sunlight and the wind. There are ways to go in and die there.</p>
                    <p>On your travels, without stars and a proper navigation, your way will be lit with bioluminescent
                        fungi and glowstone. If the path is dark, you are surrounded with darkrock. You may be surprised
                        to see old bridges and destroyed buildings but remember, these lands are full of life. That wood
                        you see, is not actually wood. Lumber like fungus and carved stalagmites are used for them, and
                        they are weak or sharp. Settling down below the caves, in the caves, underground magma rivers.
                    </p>
                    <p>This brief introduction may cause you to avoid this place, and you should. Scholars and brave
                        men, listen to my words. There are grave dangers and a different pool of magic here. Faerzress.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many cities are built where Faerzress is little to protect their cities. It messes with your
                        spells. Races below also have gear for this wild magic. They make items, gear, and wage war
                        against each other using this. Although threat doesn't even begin there. Purple worms,
                        umberhulks, zornns, Kuo-Toa and other lurk in the Underdark. You will be incredibly lucky to
                        find a recent map, if there is even any. I have the overall map that I came across, distributed
                        in these series, and have high doubts that it will ever change.</p>

                    <h1>Adventurer's Guide to Underdark 2</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Greetings adventurers to the second iteration. I'll be talking about how The Underdark's layers
                        work on this section. Reminding you that water is so scarce and fresh water is hoarded and
                        protected, some of my many gear, including notes have been traded with the natives of Underdark.
                        Interesting fact that, they use Electrum over there instead of gold. I managed to struck a
                        bargain by getting an electrum piece per 2 gold pieces.</p>
                    <p>The upperdark as they call it, underdark for children as I call it. Drow outposts and small
                        settlements take place here. They are usually near the tunnels that are really wide, strong and
                        old. Some of these tunnels may even go all the way up, to home. The main Deep Gnome Population
                        also live here as well as some underground dangers like stone giants. Here, you can eat and eat
                        and eat. You may even want to put on some weight since you'll be needing it as we descend
                        further. </p>
                    <p>Welcome to the middledark. Miles deep and huge, most visited and inhabited area with bigger
                        cities and bigger monsters. Beware that even though most of you still reading this will end up
                        here, underdark is never a friend. Some Illithids even travel in groups here, with a beholder
                        here and there. Illithids eat brains, beholders eat.. well, I don't even know if that floating
                        eye-ball has a mouth.</p>
                    <p>As we descent further, we should arrive at the lowerdark. I've never been here, and never met
                        anyone who dares to enter here. While most of the Underdark is massive caverns, glowing
                        mushrooms, stone cities, dark lakes, long tunnels, hungry everything, stale air, barren mazes,
                        toxic spores, ooze, lava, darkness, maddening silence, Lowerdark is where this all actively seek
                        out for your death. There is also little to no food, so if your portal ended up in the
                        lowerdark, hopefully you'll realize and hurry back.</p>
                    <p>The one thing you don't want to come across here, and run as fast as you can dropping any ties
                        you had, are the aboleths. Old gods of the olden times, rulers of the worlds…</p>

                    <h1>Adventurer's Guide to Underdark 3</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>If you are still reading this book series, I'll keep it information only, since you must be
                        determined to die. Let's talk about Faerzress. It is a constant radiation of magic. A magic
                        force that protects from receiving visions from different places, alters spells, limits
                        teleportation and feeds plants. That is why the mushrooms are abundant, and moss still grows
                        even in the absence of the sun. Yes you read that right, the condensed energy is a rival to our
                        sun.</p>
                    <p>There are also small places that resemble a different world or so unique called The Undergroves.
                        These can be the difference between your death and survival. I've only come across one, and it
                        is called as the Barnacle Fields by the gnomes. Cavernous area, large craters. Their hard shell
                        makes them really difficult to kill but has good meat if you can manage it. Be careful to cook
                        it well to avoid fungus infection. Do not stand on their mouth. Never a good idea.</p>
                    <p>After learning all this information, I can only hope that you don't die and come back to tell a
                        story. Maybe, you can advance the knowledge provided by this book, or completely destroy the
                        nonsense that is written here, if it is actually a nonsense then. Seek out the fourth volume for
                        a map and gear recommendations which I believe to be essential to my return. Good luck
                        adventurers.</p>

                    <p>The items I have used are as follows. These are a must, in my humble opinion. A lizard leather
                        breathing hood for spore infested caverns or gaseous chambers. A climbing kit is since
                        stalagmites, purple worm tunnels, pits, volcanic tubes, vertical shafts and many other terrain
                        is extremely dangerous and hard to traverse through. Monsters wont wait for you so a spider kit
                        and stoneburner gloves are really good. Potion bladder is also proved itself useful because you
                        are definitely going to need potions. Running and fighting happened a lot, but if need be, a
                        mister could be used for a more stealthy approach.</p>
                    <p>Best of luck to you, don't die.</p>

                    <h1>Assassination of Narra</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Kingdoms come, kingdoms go. Some see this too early in their life and some live so long that they
                        eventually realize it. People with opportunities tend to use them and that is why high-achieving
                        Mages, Clerics, Bards, and some others stick as a community rather than being a part of any
                        ruling land. There is said to be a cleric who was on this very land long before any history we
                        recall was written down. Successors who hold people’s respect and Successors who were born to
                        the right family share the same people as their source of fame. Even though generally a mage
                        doesn’t care about this fame but a Prince does. And any Prince who cares about fame plans on
                        sitting on the throne and ruling forever wants the said “mage” by his side in order to make
                        himself feel and seem trusted. </p>
                    <p>Prince Ozgu, son of Kuko was the perfect example of this. Kuko lived a little longer than
                        expected which resulted in Ozgu sitting on the throne about 10 years later than when he should.
                        That may not sound like much to some, but for a human it sure is. He spent his young adult life
                        planning his reign and one day the long wait was over. He was an ordinary king. Wanted the best
                        for himself and then his people. Liked power and knew not to cross some lines. He saw the great
                        opportunity to marry a princess to get ahold of even more land and power without any blood being
                        spilled. So he reached King Carl Clefar to marry her daughter, Victoria Clefar. King Carl
                        refused the offer but Ozgu managed to get Victoria’s heart, which left King Carl little choice.
                        Ozgu was an ambitious but good man and in plain sight, there wasn’t any reason to deny him the
                        hand of Victoria. King Carl nevertheless thought it necessary to express his power. He took Ozgu
                        for a walk through some of his Castles. He thought if he seemed strong, no harm would be done to
                        her daughter. One of the said travels was to Castle Noryein, Which is placed right next to a big
                        crater from about a hundred years ago when a meteor fell. It's said the reason Castle Noryein is
                        such a bright green is because of the glowing crater caused for about 50 years when it first
                        landed. The crash site held much power and was often visited by many mages and some druids. Some
                        traveled from other planes just to inspect it. King Ozgu had a great interest in the crash site
                        and felt it was calling for him. But he knew that he needed to seem uninterested in it for the
                        time being to gain Carl’s trust. On their journey back from Castle Noryein, Carl and Ozgu
                        learned about the terrible news that Victoria has been kidnapped. Which was planned by Ozgu
                        after he reached Castle Noryein to create an opportunity to visit the crash site. As planned
                        Ozgu and Carl moved separately to search for Victoria. After a few days, this time not according
                        to plan Victoria was found dead with her eyes, mouth, and feet cauterized. This was a way to
                        Express someone living an unhonorable life. May he/she never walk, talk or see herself without
                        the honesty of gods. This was usually done to sex workers or people who steal from where they
                        work. Carl was devastated and angry with the situation so he asked for help from some mages but
                        many were not interested. They knew with no male heir and now losing his only child, this man
                        meant so little.</p>
                    <p>Ozgu was also angry and devastated but his reasoning was different. Without a wife, he didn’t
                        hold a different future from Carl. Other kingdoms saw King Ozgu as not the person responsible
                        for the tragic death of Victoria, but since he was around there when it happened, no one wanted
                        him near their priceless princess. Ozgu turned to a mage that was living in his kingdom at the
                        time. Narra was at least a dozen hundred years old and it was possible she kept the answer. Ozgu
                        invited her to be by her side and counsel him. Narra respectfully rejected the offer and said
                        with her understanding of time she had no time to serve. Before visiting another mage, Ozgu
                        wanted to do the same thing Carl did to him. He wanted to Express his power so no mage would
                        deny him. He ordered Narra to be kicked from his Kingdom. The very next day Ozgu woke up with
                        loud noises of people shouting and demanding him dead. Narra was found dead shortly after she
                        was seen with King Ozgu. Her feet, eyes, and mouth were also cauterized and people did the math.
                        Ozgu, shocked that he didn’t see he was being betrayed by people right by his side, tried to
                        give an explanation. But his little younger brother Dahbaa told people Ozgu was a good man
                        possessed by the mages in Noryein and that the mages had a big plan to destroy all kingdoms and
                        rule everything themselves. He took charge of his country, recruited armies from some other
                        kingdoms including Carl’s, and went on a crusade to kill mages. Head of The Mages Council Magus
                        said people Dahbaa was behind all this and none of the accusations were true. Most people didn’t
                        believe them and chose to believe their King instead. Great Mage Magus knew he couldn’t let all
                        these people go around cutting people’s heads off. He couldn’t use magic to persuade these
                        people since it was the very thing they were against. He gave the Army and both brothers an
                        instant, painless death. Wrong news traveled faster and all people were convinced that mages are
                        the villain. This is how the Mages’ Crisis started.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Most people don’t kill anything in their lives and most of the people who kill things don’t kill
                        humans. The very small population of people who kill other humans at one point or another
                        usually uses magic. That leaves a very small number of people that use swords and hammers to
                        kill other people. If you also consider most of these people fight against each other and each
                        time they come across, their population decreases; it is safe to assume that if you have a bunch
                        of fighters by your side, you achieved to gather exotic people. </p>
                    <p>Life is different everywhere and so is the danger. But no matter where you live in Teothe you
                        should be threatened by the Warriors Guild. They are not only all warriors, but they are the
                        fiercest, the cruelest ones. You don’t become a guild member and then become a warrior. To even
                        attempt to join, you have to be a great warrior already. They don’t obey many laws and who can
                        make them? They are trained enough to face anyone. Just like Mages Guild, Warriors Guild is
                        untouchable in this sense. </p>
                    <p>Akairo or when fully translated to common “Red Land” is ruled by 6 knights. Very much like
                        Warriors Guild members, these people are renowned commanders and they have done enough to prove
                        their worth both in battle and in war. When your leader is a fearsome warrior though, it is
                        really hard to explain that these skills don’t exactly sit well with leadership and diplomacy.
                        But since I, the author is already banned from that land I can confidently say that these skills
                        don’t help you rule a kingdom. This isn’t propaganda but all the war Akairo has to suffer is
                        just because it's led by 6 blood-thirsty morons. Anyway, back to the point; Akairo is at war
                        with all the lands it's in contact with. Even if your army can beat the Red army (yeah very
                        creative) you wouldn’t want to fight them since you will lose people for no real reason. Their
                        land has burnt many times so nothing grows, they are in war with everyone so you can’t take the
                        lands as a part of your own before fighting all the others and they even have a civil war! So,
                        that leaves Akairo in a position where they can get away with saying anything. Or at least
                        everyone thought. Most Guilds don’t participate in wars as expected. But one of the Ruling
                        Knights of Akairo sent an invitation to the leader of Warriors Guild. Said, “either you come to
                        fight for me and earn your freedom or you don’t accept my invitation and prove what kind of
                        cowards you are”. Warriors Guild is not led by meat-brains so they just didn’t engage with
                        Akairo and ignored the courier. Ruling Knights took this as a form of unacceptable disrespect
                        since Akairo is not already at war with at least 5 Kingdoms and they absolutely have armies to
                        spare for this childish revenge. 2 Knights led an army of hundreds of people to the Mountain
                        Ararat at the 3rd full moon of the winter. Which is considered the hardest time to do the
                        Warriors Guild acceptance challenge. They interrupted the ritual which was meant to send away
                        the warriors to their test and attacked them. At that point, Chieftain of Warriors Guild ordered
                        that if any of the attendants kill less than 10 Akairo soldiers, That they would lose their
                        chance to do the test and it’ll instead be considered a failure. Warriors, some of which are
                        missing weapons and most of them missing armor, charged onto the Red Army. Newbies wanted their
                        chance to earn their Warrior’s Worth and members wanted to make sure that this kind of
                        disrespect to the Guild is never repeated. It was not a fight, it was not a battle. All of the
                        Red Army knew that they’ll die there. None of them expected to return home safely. They were not
                        wrong because none of them did. Well, I did. But I was sent back to Akairo before the end of it.
                        Knight personally ordered me to go ask for reinforcements. I never did. I never returned to
                        Akairo. I didn’t leave them to die, I saved many lives of the soldiers that were meant to be
                        reinforcements. I don’t feel guilty and I am releasing this the same day the last of those 6
                        knights have died. I didn’t give any names to keep myself safe and none of the knights at the
                        moment know about this. If you are reading about this in Akairo, just find a way to get out.
                        (Shortly after its release this book was banned in Akairo and the author was found dead in
                        Dwarven Union)</p>

                    <h1>Known Half-Ancients</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>All of these are written based on rumors and even if they are true most of these entities probably
                    don’t want to be encountered by adventurers. Just a reminder.</p>
                    <p><b>Harutya</b>: Most famous one. Travels between cities looking for odds and ends. Most cities banned her
                    because she is half ancient. She camps outside cities and since folk is always interested in her she
                    can manage to do some trade.</p>
                    <p><b>Azdial The Leg Chopper</b>: Crazed with the fact that he cannot die, he isolated himself in some unknown
                    place, some state in a plane called Thaum, little people come across him and none leave with their
                    legs intact.</p>
                    <p><b>Hemhapius</b>: Jumped into a volcano and lost his non-ancient body parts. The way he looks is disturbing
                    even for the undead. It's believed that he has been into machinery for the last few hundred years
                    and dungeons before that. He leaves light-made artifacts in machinery dungeons. Artifacts are so out
                    of this world, it's no doubt that some ancient has done it.</p>
                    <p><b>Akalea</b>: Great Faith Healer. Only appears when a newborn child is ill. Sometimes even before the
                    family knows the child is sick. These children live 2-3 times their normal lifespan. Most of them
                    organize with each other to heal and save people. It's said Akalea has a book covered with blinding
                    light and the only way to understand the knowledge inside is to be blinded by the book and then
                    healed by Akalea herself.</p>
                    <p><b>Rothareron</b>: Sets sail to the toughest seas in many planes because he has sworn a warrior’s death.
                    While he is recruiting for his crew he pays the family instead. Making it clear that the crew will
                    never come back. Most recruits are tough criminals from prison or exile.</p>
                    <p><b>Maggot Eater</b>: Most believe that this is a myth. No real name is known. Goes after dragon-sized prey
                    and kills them. Then talks to them until their body is covered with maggots. Feasts on the maggots
                    and goes for his next prey. Even though in many places of the world, large and hostile prey with
                    nothing but bones are found. Anyone who has encountered his work says that it was made by him
                    without a moment’s hesitation.</p>
                    <p><b>Gurroka</b>: Has 4 wings, 2 for travel and 2 for swiftly changing plains. Hunts down pillagers and
                    rapists between planes. It's believed to be arch-nemesis and also a relative of Rothareron.</p>
                    <p><b>Dath</b>: First things first, it's believed that the modern word “death” has its name after him. No one
                    knows his reasoning because no one speaks his language. He is Kraken-sized and walks in oceans, even
                    underwater. Whenever he comes across the land he kills everything on his way until he comes across
                    another sea. Some believe he is searching for someone with ginger hair.</p>
                    <p><b>Jotlyn</b>: Great gambler. Dresses as a jester/clown. He makes your wish come true for a price. If you
                    are between death and asking something from him; we suggest you choose death. If you are between
                    asking something from him and making a wish; we suggest you choose death.</p>
                    <p><b>Madame Chuye</b>: She refused to be the wife of a god and now she is cursed to never be wed forever.
                    Traveling mostly heavens looking for her other half. Refused the hands of Jotlyn, Rothareron, and
                    Akalea in marriage. All information about her is from people who have been raised from dead after at
                    least a dozen years so it's believed she visits each plane every dozen years (time measured in
                    Teothe).</p>
                    <p><b>Qtuyoeggg</b>: Tricked Akalea into praying for her and is believed to be immortal. Lurks waiting for
                    humanity and all the entities to fade away from existence and then to rule it all.</p>
                    <p><b>Sarguul</b>: Travels planes looking for specific ingredients. When asked what he is making, answered a
                    cold pie and a toasted soup. The only ingredient he took publicly was when he killed a Kraken
                    attacking a city because he needed an adrenaline-filled Kraken Tentacle to decorate his plate
                    better.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>HOW TO TELEPORT FOR BEGINNERS AND PEOPLE WHO DOESN’T KNOW THEY ARE BEGINNERS BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS
                        THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING BUT IN REALITY THEY DON’T ATLEAST NOT ALWAYS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY
                        YOU ALL NEED TO LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY RIGHT NOW</p>
                    <p>Did you teleport before? Did you know teleporting can go wrong? AND I MEAN REEEALLY WRONG?????
                    </p>
                    <p>No one tells you that. Because the first time you teleport is always at a sigil, a gate, a
                        whatever so the chances of something happening in a way it's not supposed to, are slim to none.
                        But teleporting to a place without a permanent circle or an associated object has risks. Real
                        risks. The risk of dying is one of them. I once found myself at the top of a mountain freezing
                        my ass off because some idiot gave me a false description. Yeah, don’t do that. MAKE SURE YOUR
                        DESCRIPTION IS VERY REAL AND VERY CORRECT. People think it 10 times before they send a message
                        with sending but they think once or twice before teleporting. Mostly because if you think 10
                        times about teleporting you’ll probably just take a god damn ship to there. ONCE WE TELEPORTED
                        AND MY WIFE SAID SHE NO LONGER HAS FEELINGS FOR ME! I mean if only I knew the risks of that
                        happening. We had a great marriage and this was one hundred percent because of the
                        teleportation. I honestly don’t see the point in teleporting anymore but I know most of you
                        idiots won't stop it so I suggest at least teleport FROM a circle TO a circle and quadruple
                        check your information.</p>

                    <h1>Legend of Rerartif</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>As a young boy Rerartif was into sculptures. He would petrify some people and make some
                        sculptures looking just like them. Then he would kidnap more people, make them guess which one
                        is the sculpture and if the answer was wrong he would petrify them and add them to his
                        collection. Bounties have been put on him and many adventurers looking for either adventure,
                        money, or revenge went after him. He killed all of them and kept doing his work. Later he made
                        the whole city and then the whole kingdom his enemy. He killed anyone who interrupted his work
                        and kept doing his art. And at one point people attacked his sculptures instead. Breaking almost
                        all of them. After that, he went mad killing everything. This time not sparing the innocent or
                        the passive. He tried to convince some gods to reverse the time just before his sculptures were
                        destroyed. None answered his call. Then he destroyed the shrines of every god he tried to
                        contact. Said, “if you keep ignoring me I’ll do the same to all your followers”. He shattered
                        the sky and denied humanity rain and sun. Fought avatars of Greater-Gods. When his body was
                        dying of old age he refused to end his reign and became a lich. It believed he got what he
                        wanted because all of his sculptures are in one piece. They are up in Elkian Dominion and it's
                        too risky to look at them directly. Not because sculptures are petrifying anyone who looks at
                        them or anything, purely because if you unknowingly form a negative or indifferent opinion about
                        them, he’ll come to hunt you and even the gods can’t stop him.</p>

                    <h1>What is Electricity? - Part I</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>For starters, I would like to introduce myself. I am the all-known but not all-knowing alchemist
                        Lord Patrick Goldgrain. My family has been the owners of the great Goldgrain Farms for hundreds
                        of years and they have always been beloved by the people who work under them because of their
                        generosity. I studied alchemy and learned magic growing up. My father was my first mentor and
                        then I have traveled to the great libraries of the World and spent a fortune to order books or
                        to get them translated. All my research has been done by me and the people who work for me. We
                        have been on this project for the last 23 years and I have decided to make a fair amount of this
                        information public knowledge. </p>
                    <p>To understand electricity, we must first understand the humanoid body. We have blood in our veins
                        that carry life to our organs. Blood travels through veins and finds the organ it needs to feed.
                        Later the blood is returned through a different vein to the starting point and it completes a
                        full tour.</p>
                    <p>The same thing goes for electricity. Electricity can run through metallic “veins” in order to
                        reach “organs”. Organs in this subject are almost all alive creatures and some objects.
                        Electricity enters the system or the item, runs through it, and then gets out using another
                        canal. It is not as easy to see electricity leave through a different canal for 2 reasons:</p>
<pre>
    1. Electricity moves way too fast so watching it happen doesn’t give us the insight we need.
    2. Electricity Particles are smaller than Blood Particles so the width of the canal electricity
    requires is significantly smaller.
</pre>
                    <p>If you don’t want something alive to not be affected by electricity here is some ways you can do
                        that:</p>
<pre>
    1. Infuse armor with lightning resistance (or if you are rich enough lightning immunity)
    2. Get a big wood shield and protect yourself with it. No metal parts to not let electricity
    possess your shield. No thin-leather or easily flammable wood either because electricity also
    heats the material it's engaged with.
    3. If you have rubber where you live, you can get it in a glass shape and put it on top of the
    source of electricity. Rubber is the greatest way to stop electricity. If you are interested in
    rubber-enhanced armor you can always visit Goldgrain castle and see the blacksmith. It is pricy
    but we have tested it against level 4-5 lightning spells and our pet Lightning Elemental Wiffy.
</pre>
                    <p>If you want to isolate a structure in a way that electricity cannot get past it, you also have to
                        consider the heat. The best option for price-efficiency is concrete.</p>
                    <p>Now that we have settled who I am and how to protect ourselves from lethal doses of electricity,
                        we can start talking about its chemistry.</p>
                    <p>Electricity is a resource just like food, water, daylight, weave, and pulling force under Teothe.
                        (For detailed information about the pulling force see the book: GRAVITING IT ALL). We can use
                        this resource once we shape it. Just like we need to chew to food to shape it. The best way to
                        transform electricity through a canal is to use a copper-gold mixture. To discriminate against
                        any chance of leaks you need to also cover it with rubber. This also helps with protecting your
                        copper-gold mixture. You dig a canal about 1 in 100 compared to a water canal, put the rubber,
                        copper-gold, and then rubber again. Like a rubber-copper sandwich with rubber as the bread and
                        the copper-gold as the Goldgrain Deer Leg Meat cooked on low heat over 14 hours and then smoked
                        with carrots and potatoes. Unlike a sandwich, you have to cover all sides to make the isolation
                        work. </p>
                    <p>Electricity as a resource is more useful than most workers. It can turn something way faster than
                        a human with high dexterity and can smash something way stronger than an orc. To see my crafts
                        that ease daily life and are cost-efficient in long term, visit my castle at Goldgrain. (I also
                        offer accomodation support for a reasonable price)</p>
                    <p>One of the best ways I have found to use electricity is either to reflect it on a strong metal
                        and use the metal surface’s heat. Be careful to not touch it through something that carries
                        electricity. If you want the full list of things that reflect electricity or carry it, You can
                        visit the library in my castle at Goldgrain.</p>
                    <p>One more way to consider using electricity is something that is still under research but is
                        showing great possibilities. If you manage to make a really thin copper in a form of a chain and
                        then put it in really small glass pieces, you can use it as a bright light resource. At least
                        24,567452034 times brighter than the average Goldgrain Candle.</p>
                    <p>For more information about electricity and how it can be used, or if you are a sage interested in
                        this, you can visit Goldgrain Castle.</p>

                    <h1>What is Electricity? - Part II</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To understand references and subjects in this book, you must first read “What is Electricity? -
                        Part I”</p>
                    <p>In the last book I have mentioned who I am but in case some people skipped the first book or that
                        part of the book I’ll have to introduce myself again. I am Lord Patrick Goldgrain. Lord of the
                        Famous Goldgrain Farms and mighty Goldgrain Castle. My forefathers have been the Lord of
                        Goldgrain for decades and everyone that has been in our presence left with a joy.</p>
                    <p>Me and my work has gotten a lot of attention which I think is caused by my ability as a
                        wordsmith. We Goldgrains have it in our blood to be a true talent in any form of art we decide.
                        I have a lot more sages and wizards working for my research so please stop asking to be a part
                        of it. I will let everyone know when we are in need of more people.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to say the research for electricity-based lamps instead of flaming ones has been
                        complete. For pricing of electricity systems and different strengths of electric lamps visit the
                        Market of Light in Goldgrain (Not the one in Greyland, that one is run by paladins)</p>
                    <p>What I previously called the “heat of electricity” is now called Juul Heating. Named after my cat
                        that died from it. May she rest in peace. </p>
                    <p>We have done some blocks filled with metal parts that carry electricity and keep them in the
                        designated area for a long time. With this, you can use electricity as a source of heat without
                        the worry of getting electrocuted. The whole thing is way too heavy so we suggest you send a
                        letter of order. It is 6000 GP and every week it carried by a cart is 700 GP (you have the right
                        to carry it to your spot yourself, but if it breaks on the way we won’t pay you back)</p>
                    <p>We have opened a factory in Dwarven Union because it is cheaper to find the metal and find the
                        people to Smith it there. We travel it by sea and pay a ton of taxes so everything is more
                        expensive now. This is a sacrifice all humanity has to make because results show that we are
                        producing at least 3 times the normal amount. So it makes sense that the prices are 4 times the
                        normal amount as well.</p>
                    <p>I think this is a good opportunity to reach out to Wilson’s fleet. The rock gnome we have been in
                        contact with is no longer taxing us. We have to explain what we do and the pricing again. We
                        would like the rock gnome named Mermaid back on the business so things can run smoothly. We have
                        no intention of not paying our part but we would like to not have to explain our cargo every
                        run.</p>
                    <p>Neighbour lands to Goldgrain (Greenland, Greenreach, Goldreach, Jyortt) have been purchased by
                        me, one and only Lord Patrick Goldgrain. I have turbines working to transform other sources of
                        energy into electricity in order to experiment more with it. I had to talk about this not only
                        to show my success but also to stop the worrying commons who think something underground is
                        coming up with its claws. </p>
                    <p>We have also made an Electricity Castle next to the great Goldgrain Castle (which is next to the
                        old Goldgrain Castle). It has an entire floor to make things cold. Really cold. Putting things
                        underground only makes them a little cold. This is really really cold. We have put a hundred
                        kilos of Deer meat and we are testing if the meat is still good to eat every month since it's
                        done. 7 months in and it is still as tasty as day one. It is safe to assume this is about the
                        Goldgrain Deer meat which you can buy at Goldgrain for a reasonable price. </p>
                    <p>We have some clerics who are able to do sending working with some wizards and alchemists to make
                        a sending-machine. This is still at an early stage but our target is to place one in every city
                        in every kingdom. This way you can do sending to anywhere in the World for a reasonable price
                        even without needing a cleric.</p>

                    <h1>What is Electricity? – Part III</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>As you all know I am Lord Patrick Goldgrain and I strongly advise you to read the following books
                        first:</p>
                    <p>What is Electricity? – Part I & What is Electricity? – Part II</p>
                    <p>I am proud to announce that I have purchased more of our neighbors. I won’t be giving names this
                        time since I will be obtaining even more. I also purchased a place near Hephai just because it
                        was called Graingold. There is a teleportation circle to Goldgrain from there for the only 200GP
                        (Previously some people accidentally went there).</p>
                    <p>If you have bought our previous books and our creations, this is going to be great news for you;
                        We now sell electricity. Not in containers or in bottles even though we are also working on
                        that. We sell electricity wherever you are. Just purchase a call from your city’s town at the
                        electro-sender to Goldgrain Electricity Institution and our team will arrive at your address,
                        set you an electricity farm, and let you use it as much as you want for a reasonable price.
                        //özgür find better names for things</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we have no service to Akario nor there will be because our couriers have been
                        attacked by numerous entities. I also have a new set of rules to sell my services and the full
                        list of rules is as follows:</p>
<pre>
    Your purchases should add up to 6000GP at a time. Any trade less than that will not be
    considered.
    You have to have a royal title in order to purchase anything.
    To have your services delivered, you must first ransom 10000GP to any bank of your choosing.
    To use (or see) electro-senders you should first purchase a yearly subscription for only 400GP.
    Anyone that has been a citizen of Akairo in the last 10 years or anyone that has lived there
    longer than 5 years should report this information before any purchase, if I find it out with my
    resources I will not be paying you a refund.
</pre>
                    <p>Now knowing all these are out of the way, I can explain the procedure to create electricity at
                        your place and why you should buy it;</p>
                    <p>Similar to what I said in Part I, electricity is a form of energy no different than food or
                        weave. To get the energy from food, you have to have the right set of organs to consume and
                        transform it and the same goes for weave. Since most structures cannot bend weave or eat food,
                        electricity and steam pressure are the best options. Steam is a tricky material to use and even
                        the smallest flaw in the machinery causes the system to fail. Unlike steam, electricity systems
                        usually are not as fragile, and if something goes out of the way the worst thing that can happen
                        is the worker carrying it frying in a few seconds. I have done the math and it is cheaper to pay
                        the family than to be careful enough to prevent it. </p>
                    <p>The first and the most suggested method we use to obtain electricity is to use wind turbines. If
                        your castle is on high ground, this is even more effective. We build the electric barrels and
                        the turbines for a reasonable price and for another reasonable price we let you hire a guy who
                        can run it. (race is optional, we have most of them)</p>
                    <p>Another method, for castles in odd places, is to use a friction machine powered by steam.
                        Friction causes electricity when both materials are fit. My advisors told me to get the names of
                        said materials out in order to prevent fake copies or homemade ones. It takes significantly less
                        space and creates a decent amount of electricity. If steam is also a problem at your castle, you
                        can set 2 of your workers on the bicycle part of the machine. Their energy will be stored as
                        electricity.</p>
                    <p>Lastly and highly experimental is electric shields. We set a shield that stores any electrical
                        energy that is engaging it. You can have your wizard struck it with lightning or something
                        similar whenever you need to store some more. (no spell higher than level 6)</p>
                    <p>It is also worth mentioning that I have decided to sell a limited amount of these each year in
                        order to make it a treat to those who have it. It would be a nightmare if every castle or even
                        every home had its own electricity. The first set of machinery of the year is the cheapest.
                        Every machinery sold increases the price of the next one by 25GP permanently. I had to take this
                        precaution to keep it as unpopular as possible so we, deserving rich, can enjoy our specialness.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also to read Part IV and possibly more, you need to come to visit Goldgrain in winter and get in
                        line once it's released. Or we can deliver it to you via a courier if you already have the
                        Goldgrain Electricity services for a reasonable price.</p>
